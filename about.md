## About This Site

*The Gospel From Gravel Hill* is a continuation, and a new chapter, of a work that began as *The Glorious Gospel*. For over a decade, under the expert care of **Scott G. MacLeod**, that site faithfully proclaimed *“the glorious gospel of the blessed God”* (1 Timothy 1:11). It pointed both believers and unbelievers to the person and work of the Lord Jesus Christ.

With Scott’s blessing, I seeks to carry that torch forward through this site, not as a replica, but as a living witness in a fresh setting. The name now reflects my own home place on Prince Edward Island, **Gravel Hill** a reminder that the gospel is not confined to pulpits or platforms, but can shine from anywhere the Lord plants His people.

## A Personal Word

My full gospel testimony can be read [here](https://heaven4sure.com/my-journey-to-christ-marc-macarthur/), but in short: I grew up knowing *about* the Bible without knowing the Saviour. Church, when I attended, was routine and without meaning to me. For most of my adult life, God was distant acknowledged but unknown.

In **November 2022**, my fiancée, Emily, passed away suddenly after sixteen years together. In my grief, I began attending Gospel meetings at O’Leary Gospel Hall out of a sense of obligation to thank them for their kindness, but the messages I heard stirred questions I could not ignore. Over the next months I read the Bible, listened to preaching, and wrestled with the reality of my sin and my need of salvation.

On the morning of **March 10, 2023**, while sitting in my car outside the hospital where Emily’s final journey began, I listened to a Gospel message by Jack Hay. When he read:

<p style="text-align:center;"><em>“whosoever shall call on the name of the LORD shall be delivered.”</em> <BR> — Joel 2:32</p>

I realised salvation was not in religion or my efforts, but in calling upon the Lord Himself. Right there, I admitted my guilt, believed Christ died for **my** sins, and trusted Him completely. The weight of my sin was lifted, and I passed from death unto life (John 5:24).

## Why This Site Exists

1. **To make Christ known to the lost** - because without Him there is no hope.  
2. **To encourage believers** - to walk closely with the Lord, rooted in His Word.

This site exists to point people to the Lord Jesus Christ through the Gospel, the good news that He died for our sins, was buried, and rose again the third day, according to the Scriptures. You’ll find articles, tracts, books, and audio messages designed to clearly and faithfully present God’s way of salvation, along with resources to encourage believers in their walk with the Lord.

I pray that what you read here will lead you to consider life’s most important question: *“What think ye of Christ?”* (Matthew 22:42).
