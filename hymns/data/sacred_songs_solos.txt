Praise, My Soul, the King of Heaven

PRAISE, my soul, the King of heaven;
To His feet thy tribute bring;
Ransomed, healed, restored, forgiven,
Who like thee His praise shall sing?
Praise Him! praise Him!
Praise the everlasting King!

Praise Him for His grace and favour
To our fathers in distress;
Praise Him, still the same as ever,
Slow to chide, and swift to bless:
Praise Him! praise Him!
Glorious in His faithfulness!

Father-like He tends and spares us,
Well our feeble frame He knows;
In His bands He gently bears us,
Rescues us from all our foes:
Praise Him! praise Him!
Widely as His mercy flows.

Angels, help us to adore Him,
Ye behold Him face to face!
Sun and moon, bow down before Him!
Dwellers all in time and space,
Praise Him! praise Him!
Praise with us the God of grace!

A Mighty Fortress Is Our God

A MIGHTY fortress is our God,
A bulwark never failing:
Our Helper He, amid the flood
Of mortal ills prevailing.
For still our ancient foe
Doth seek to work his woe;
His craft and power are great.
And armed with cruel hate-
On earth is not his equal.

Did we in our own strength confide
Our striving would be losing,
Were not the right Man on our side,
The Man of God's own choosing.
Dost ask who that may be?
Christ Jesus, it is He!
Lord Sabaoth is His name.
From age to age the same:
And He must win the battle.

And though this world, with devils filled,
Should threaten to undo us:
We will not fear; for God hath willed
His truth to triumph through us.
Let goods and kindred go,
This mortal life also;
The body they may kill:
God's truth abideth still,
His Kingdom is for ever.


3
A Safe Stronghold Our God is Still

A SAFE stronghold our God is still,
A trusty shield and weapon;
He'll help us clear from all the ill
That hath us now o'ertaken.
The ancient prince of hell
Hath risen with purpose fell;
Strong mail of craft and power
He weareth in this hour,
On earth is not his fellow.

With force of arms we nothing can,
Full soon were we down-ridden;
But for us fights the proper Man,
Whom God Himself hath bidden.
Ask ye, Who is this same?
Christ Jesus is His name,
The Lord Sabaoth's Son; He,
and no other one,
Shall conquer in the battle.

And were this world all devils o'er,
And watching to devour us,
We lay it not to heart so sore;
Not they can overpower us.
And let the prince of ill
Look grim as e'er he will,
He harms us not a whit:
For why? His doom is writ;
A word shall quickly slay him.

God's word, for all their craft and force,
One moment will not linger,
But, spite of hell, shall have its course;
'Tis written by His finger.
And though they take our life,
Goods, honour, children, wife,
Yet is their profit small;
These things shall vanish all,
The city of God remaineth.

The God of Abraham praise!

THE God of Abraham praise!
Who reigns enthroned above,
Ancient of everlasting days,
And God of love!
Jehovah, great I AM!
By earth and Heaven confest!
I bow, and bless the sacred name,
For ever blest!

The God of Abraham praise!
At whose supreme command
From earth I rise, and seek the joys
At His right hand:
I all on earth forsake,
Its wisdom, fame, and power,
And Him my only portion make,
My Shield and Tower.

The God of Abraham praise!
I Whose all-sufficient grace
Shall guide me all my happy days
In all my ways:
He calls a worm His friend!
He calls Himself my God!
And He shall save me to the end
Through Jesus' blood!

He by Himself hath sworn
I on His oath depend; '
I shall, on eagles' wings upborne,
To heaven ascend:
I shall behold His face,
I shall His power adore,
And sing the wonders of His grace
For evermore!

The whole triumphant host
Give thanks to God on high:
"Hail! Father, Sou, and Holy Ghost!"
They ever cry:
Hail! Abraham's God and mine!
I join the heavenly lays;
All might and majesty are Thine,
And endless praise!


5
Thou whose almighty word

Thou whose almighty word
Chaos and darkness heard,
And took their flight,
Hear us, we humbly pray;
And, where the Gospel day
Sheds not its glorious ray,
"Let there be light!"

Thou, who didst come to bring.
On Thy redeeming wing,
Healing and sight­
Health to the sick in mind,
Sight to the inly blind­
Oh,now to all mankind
"Let there be light!"

Spirit of truth and love,
Life-giving, holy Dove,
Speed forth Thy flight I
Move on the waters' face
By Thine almighty grace,
And in earth's darkest place
"Let there be light!"

Blessed and holy Three,
Glorious Trinity,
Wisdom, love. might;
Boundless as ocean's tide
Rolling in fullest pride,
O'er the world far and wide,
"Let there be light!"


6
Come, Thou almighty King,

Come, Thou almighty King,
Help us Thy name to sing,
Help us to praise:
Father all-glorious,
O'er all victorious,
Come, and reign over us,
Ancient of Days!

Come, Thou incarnate Word,
Gird on Thy mighty sword;
Our prayer attend:
Come, and Thy people bless,
And give Thy Word success:
Spirit of holiness,
On us descend!

Come, Holy Comforter,
Thy sacred witness bear,
In this glad hour:
Thou. who almighty art,
Now rule in every heart,
And ne'er from us depart,
Spirit of power!

To the great One in Three
The highest praises be,
Hence evermore!
His sovereign majesty
May we in glory see,
And to eternity
Love and adore.


7
GLORY to God on high!

GLORY to God on high!
Let heaven and earth reply,
"Praise ye His name!"
His love and grace adore,
Who all our sorrows bore;
Sing loud for evermore,
"Worthy the Lamb!"

While they around the throne
Cheerfully join in one,
Praising His name,-
Ye who have felt His blood
Sealing your peace with God,
Sound His dear name abroad!
"Worthy the Lamb!"

Join, all ye ransomed race,
Our Lord and God to bless;
Praise ye His name!
In Him we will rejoice,
And make a joyful noise,
Shouting with heart and voice,
"Worthy the Lamb!"

What though we change our place,
Yet we shall never cease
Praising His name;
To Him our songs we bring,
Hail Him our gracious King,
And without ceasing sing,
"Worthy the Lamb!"


8
Grace! 'Tis a Charming Sound

GRACE! 'tis a charming sound,
Harmonious to the ear;
Heaven with the echo shall resound,
And all the earth shall hear.

c
Saved by grace alone;
This is all my plea-
Jesus died for all mankind,
And Jesus died for me.

'Twas grace that wrote my name
In life's eternal book;
'Twas grace that gave me to the Lamb,
Who all my sorrows took.

Grace taught my wandering feet
To tread the heavenly road;
And new supplies each hour I meet,
While pressing on to God.

Grace taught my soul to pray,
And made mine eyes o'erflow;
'Twas grace which kept me to this day,
And will not let me go.

Oh, let Thy grace inspire
My soul with strength divine!
May all my powers to Thee aspire,
And all my days be Thine.


9
ALL people that on earth do dwell,

ALL people that on earth do dwell,
Sing to the Lord with cheerful voice:
Him serve with mirth, His praise forth tell,
Come ye before Him and rejoice.

Know that the Lord is God indeed,
Without our aid He did us make:
We are His flock, He doth us feed,
And for His sheep He doth us take.

Oh, enter then His gates with praise,
Approach with joy His courts unto:
Praise,laud,and bless His name always,
For it is seemly so to do. 

For why? the Lord our God is good,
His mercy is for ever sure;
His truth at all times firmly stood,
And shall from age to age endure.


10
DAY by day the manna fell;

DAY by day the manna fell;
Oh to learn this lesson well!
Still by constant mercy fed,
Give us, Lord, our daily bread.

"Day by day," the promise reads,
Daily strength for daily needs;
Cast foreboding fear away,
Take the manna of to-day.

Thou our daily task shalt give;
Day by day to Thee we live:
So shall added years fulfil­
Notour own, our Father's will.


11
OH, worship the King,

OH, worship the King,
All glorious above!
Oh, gratefully sing
His power and His love;
Our Shield and Defender,
The Ancient of Days,
Pavilioned in splendour,
And girded with praise.

Oh, tell of His might,
Oh, sing of His grace!
Whose robe is the light,
Whose canopy space;
His chariots of wrath
The deep thunder-clouds form,
And dark is His path
On the wings of the storm.

The earth with its store
Of wonders untold,
Almighty! Thy power
Hath founded of old:
Hath 'stablished it fast
By a changeless decree;
And round it hath cast,
Like a mantle, the sea.

Thy bountiful care,
What tongue can recite?
It breathes in the air,
It shines in the light;
It streams from the hills,
It descends to the plain,
And sweetly distils in
The dew and the rain.

Frail children of dust,
And feeble as frail-
InThee do we trust,
Nor find Thee to fail:
Thy mercies how tender,
How firm to the end!
Our Maker, Defender,
Redeemer, and Friend!

O measureless Might!
Ineffable Love!
While angels delight
To hymn Thee above,
The humbler creation,
Though feeble their lays,
With true adoration
Shall sing to Thy praise.


12
OH, praise ye the Lord

OH, praise ye the Lord
With heart and with voice;
His mercies record,
And round Him rejoice.
Ye children of Zion,
Your Saviour adore!
And learn to rely on
His grace evermore.

Repose on His arm,
Ye sheep of His fold,
What terror can harm
With Him to uphold?
His saints are His treasure,
Their peace will He seek,
And pour without measure
His gifts on the meek.

Go on in His might,
Ye men of the Lord:
His word be your light,
His promise your sword:
The King of Salvation
Your foes will subdue,
Bring forth your oblation,
Your praises renew.


13
THOUGH troubles assail,

THOUGH troubles assail,
And dangers affright;
Though friends should all fail,
And foes all unite-
Yet one thing secures us,
Whatever betide:
The Scripture assures us,
"The Lord will provide."

The birds, without barn
Or storehouse, are fed;
From them let us learn
To trust for our bread:
His saints what is fitting
Shall ne'er be denied,
So long as 'tis written,
"The Lord will provide."

His can we obey,
Like Abram of old,
Not knowing our way;
But faith makes us bold:
For though we are stranglers,
We have a good Guide;
And trust in all dangers:
"The Lord will provide."

No strength of our own,
Or goodness we claim;
Yet since we have known
The Saviour's great name,
In this our strong tower
For safety we hide,
Almighty His power:
"The Lord will provide."


14
BEGONE, unbelief,

BEGONE, unbelief,
My Saviour is near,
And for my relief
Will surely appear:
By prayer let me wrestle,
And He will perform;
With Christ in the vessel,
I smile at the storm.

Though dark be my way,
Since He is my Guide,
'Tis mine to obey,
'Tis His to provide:
Though cisterns be broken,
And creatures all fail,
The word He hath spoken
Shall surely prevail.

His love, in time past,
Forbids me to think
He'll leave me at last
In trouble to sink:
Each sweet Ebenezer
I have in review
Confirms His good pleasure
To help me quite through.

Why should I complain
Of want or distress,
Temptation or pain '!-
He told me no less;
The heirs of salvation,
I know from His Word,
Through much tribulation
Must follow their Lord.

How bitter that cup
No heart can conceive,
Which He drank quite up,
That sinners might live!
His way was much rougher
And darker than mine;
Did Christ, my Lord, suffer,
And shall I repine?

Since all that I meet
Shall work for my good,
The bitter is sweet,
The medicine, food;
Though painful at present,
'Twill cease before long,
And then-oh, how pleasant
The conqueror's song!


15
LET us sing of the love of the Lord,

LET us sing of the love of the Lord,
As now unto Him we draw nigh;
Let us sing to the praise of the God of all grace,
For the love that gave Jesus to die!

c
Oh, the love that gave Jesus to die!
The love that gave Jesus to die!
Praise God, it is mine, this love so divine,-
The love that gave Jesus to die!

Oh, how great was the love that was shown
To us!-we can never tell why­
Not to angels, but men; let us praise him again,
For the love that gave Jesus to die!

Now this love unto all God commends,
Not one would His mercy pass by;
"Whosoever shall call, "there is pardon for all
In the love that gave Jesus to die!

Who is he that can separate those
Whom God doth in love justify?
Whatsoever we need He includes in the deed
In the love that gave Jesus to die!


16
REDEMPTION I oh, wonderful story­

REDEMPTION I oh, wonderful story­
Glad message for you and for me:
That Jesus has purchased our pardon,
And paid all the debt on the tree.

c
Believe it, O sinner, believe it;
Receive the glad message--'tis true;
Trust now in the crucified Saviour:
Salvation He offers to you.

From death unto life He hath brought us,
And made us by grace sons of God;
A fountain is opened for sinners:
Oh, wash and be cleansed in the blood!

No longer shall sin have dominion,
Though present to tempt and annoy;
For Christ, in His blessed redemption,
The power of sin shall destroy.

Accept now God's offer of mercy;
To Jesus, oh hasten to-day;
For He will receive him that cometh,
And never will turn him away.


17
Goo loved the world of sinners lost

Goo loved the world of sinners lost
And ruined by the Fall;
Salvation full, at highest cost.
He offers free to all.

c
Oh, 'twas love, 'twas wondrous love,
The love of God to me!
It brought my Saviour from above,
To die on Calvary,

E'en now by faith I claim Him mine,
The risen Son of God;
Redemption by His death I find,
And cleansing through the Blood.

Love brings the glorious fulness in,
And to His saints makes known
The blessed rest from inbred sin,
Through faith in Christ alone.

Believing souls, rejoicing go;
There shall to you be given
A glorious foretaste, here below,
Of endless life in heaven.

Of victory now o'er Satan's power
Let all the ransomed sing,
And triumph in the dying hour,
Through Christ the Lord, our King.


18
IN grace the holy God

IN grace the holy God
Did full salvation plan,
Electing in His sovereign grace
To save rebellious man.

c
By grace are ye saved through faith,
Through faith, through faith,
Through faith, and that not of yourselves,
Through faith, and that not of yourselves,
Not of works, not of works,
Not of works, lest any man should boast:
It is the gift of God.
Not of works, lest any man should boast:
It is the gift of God.
It is the gift of God; it is the gift of God;
It is the gift of God-the gift of God.

This grace of God appears
In Jesus Christ His Son,
He, lifted on the cross of shame,
The grace of God makes known.

To all who do believe
In God, through Christ revealed,
By grace they full salvation have,
And" sons of God" are sealed.


19
IN some way or other

IN some way or other
The Lord will provide:
It may not be my way,
It may not be thy way;
And yet, in His own way,
"The Lord will provide."

c
Then we'll trust in the Lord,
And He will provide:
Yes, we'll trust in the Lord,
And He will provide.

At some time or other
The Lord will provide:
It may not be my time,
It may not be thy time;
And yet, in His own time,
"The Lord will provide."

Despond then no longer;
The Lord will provide;
And this be the token­
Noword He hath spoken
Was ever yet broken:
"The Lord will provide."

March on then right boldly;
The sea shall divide;
The pathway made glorious,
With shoutings victorious,
We'll join in the chorus,
"The Lord will provide."


20
COME sing, my soul, and praise the Lord,

COME sing, my soul, and praise the Lord,
Who hath redeemed thee by His blood;
Delivered thee from chains that bound,
And brought thee to redemption ground.

c
Redemption ground, the ground of peace
Redemption ground, oh, wondrous grace
Here let our praise to God abound,
Who saves us on REDEMPTION GROUND!

Once from my God I wandered far,
And with His holy will made war;
But now my songs to God abound;
I'm standing on redemption ground.

Oh, joyous hour when God to me
A vision gave of Calvary;
My bonds were loosed, my soul unbound:
i sang upon redemption ground.

No works of merit now I plead,
But Jesus take for all my need;
No righteousness in me is found,
Except upon redemption ground.

Come, weary soul, and here find rest;
Accept redemption, and be blest:
The Christ who died, by God is crowned
To pardon on redemption ground.


21
BEHOLD, what love, what boundless love

BEHOLD, what love, what boundless love
The Father hath bestowed 
On sinners lost, that we should be
Now called" the sons of God!"

c
"Behold, what manner of love!
what manner of love
the Father hath bestowed upon us,
That we, that we should be called,
Should be called the sons of God!

No longer far from Him, but now
By"precious blood" made nigh,
Accepted in the "Well-beloved,"
Near to God's heart we lie.

What we in glory soon shall be,
It doth not yet appear;
But when our precious
Lord we see,
We shall His image bear.

With such a blessed hope in view,
We would more holy be,
More like our risen, glorious Lord,
Whose face we soon shall see.


22
Holy, Holy, Holy!

Holy, Holy, Holy!
Lord God Almighty!
Early in the morning
our song shall rise to Thee;
Holy, Holy, Holy!
Merciful and Mighty!
God in Three Persons,
blessed Trinity!

Holy, Holy, Holy! 
All the saints adore Thee,
Casting down their golden crowns
around the glassy sea;
Cherubim and Seraphim
falling down before Thee,
Which wert, and art,
and evermore shalt be.

Holy, Holy, Holy!
though the dark­ ness hide Thee,
Though the eye of sinful man
Thy glory may not see:
Only Thou art holy,
there is none beside Thee,
Perfect in power,
in love, and purity.

Holy, Holy, Holy!
Lord God Almighty!
All Thy works shall praise Thy name
in earth, and sky, and sea;
Holy, Holy, Holy!
Merciful and Mighty!   
God in Three Persons,
blessed Trinity!


23
To God be the glory! great things He hath done:

To God be the glory! great things He hath done:
So loved He the world that He gave us His Son;
Who yielded His life an atonement for sin,
And opened the Life-gate that all may go in.

c
Praise the Lord! praise the Lord!
Let the earth hear His voice! 
Praise the Lord! praise the Lord,
Let the people rejoice!
Oh, come to the Father,
through Jesus the Son;
And give Him the glory-
great things He hath done!

O perfect redemption, the purchase of blood,
To every believer the promise of God
The vilest offender who truly believes,
That moment from Jesus a pardon receives.

Great things He hath taught us,
great things He hath done,
And great our rejoicing through Jesus the Son;
But purer, and higher, and greater will be
Our wonder, our transport, when Jesus we see.


24
HARK! what mean those holy voices

HARK! what mean those holy voices
Sweetly sounding in the skies?
Lo! th' angelic host rejoices,
Loudest hallelujahs rise.

Listen to the wondrous story
Which they chant in hymns of joy:
"Glory in the highest, glory!
Glory be to God most high.

"Peace on earth, good-will from heaven
Reaching far as man is found;
Souls redeemed and sins forgiven,
Loud our golden harps shall sound.

"Christ is born! the great Anointed!
Heaven and earth His glory sing;
Oh receive whom God appointed
For your Prophet, Priest, and King!

"Hasten, mortals, to adore Him,
Learn His name and taste His joy,
Til lin heaven ye sing before Him­
Glory be to God most high!"

Let us learn the wondrous story
Of our great Redeemer's birth;
Spread the brightness of His glory,
Till it cover all the earth.


25
HARK, the glad sound! the Saviour comes!

HARK, the glad sound! the Saviour comes!
The Saviour promised long;
Let every heart exult with joy,
And every voice be song!

He comes! the prisoners to release,
In Satan's bondage held;
The gates of brass before Him burst,
The iron fetters yield.

He comes! the broken hearts to bind
The bleeding souls to cure; 
And with the treasures of His grace
To enrich the humble poor.

Our glad hosannas, Prince of Peace!
Thy welcome shall proclaim;
And heaven's exalted arches ring
With Thy most honoured name.


26
O LITTLE town of Bethlehem,

O LITTLE town of Bethlehem,
How still we see thee lie!
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep
The silent stars go by;
Yet in thy dark streets shineth
The everlasting Light;
The hopes and fears of all the years
Are met in thee to-night!

For Christ is born of Mary;
And gathered all above,
While mortals sleep, the angels keep
Their watch of wondering love.
O morning stars, together
Proclaim the holy birth,
And praises sing to God the King,
And peace to men on earth!

How silently, how silently,
The wondrous gift is given!
So God imparts to human hearts
The blessings of His heaven.
No ear may hear His coming;
But in this world of sin,
Where meek souls will receive Him still,
The dear Christ enters in.

O holy Child of Bethlehem,
Descend to us, we pray;
Cast out our sin and enter in;
Be born in us to-day!
We hear the holy angels
The great glad tidings tell-
O,come to us, abide with us,
Our Lord Emmanuel!


27
NEVER shone a light so fair,

NEVER shone a light so fair,
Never fell so sweet a song,
As the chorus in the air
Chanted by the angel throng;
Every star took up the story:

c
"Christ has come, the Prince of glory,
Come in humble hearts to dwell;
God with us, God with us,
God with us, Immanuel!"

Still that Jubilee of song
Breaks upon the rising morn;
While the anthem rolls along,
Floods of light the earth adorn;
Old and young take up the story:

Welcome now the blessed day,
When we praise the Lord our King;
When we meet to praise and pray,
And His love with gladness sing;
Let the world take up the story:


28
ROLLING downward through the mid- night,

ROLLING downward through the mid- night,
Comes a glorious burst of heavenly song;
'Tis a chorus full of sweetness-­
And the singers are an angel throng.

"Glory I glory in the highest!
On the earth good-will
and peace to men!"
Down the ages send the echo;
Let the glad earth shout again!

Wondering shepherds see the glory,
Hear the word the
shining ones declare;
At the manger fall in worship, 
While the music fills the quivering air.

Christ the Saviour, God's Anointed,
Comes to earth our
fearful debt to pay­
Man of Sorrows, and rejected,
Lamb of God, that takes our sin away.


29
ANGELS, from the realms of glory,

ANGELS, from the realms of glory,
Wing your flight o'er all the earth;
Ye who sang creation's story,
Now proclaim Messiah's birth:
Come and worship!
Worship Christ, the new-born King!

Shepherds in the field abiding,
Watching o'er their flocks by night,
God with man is now residing,
Yonder shines the Infant-light:
Come and worship!
Worship Christ, the new-born King!

Sages, leave your contemplations;
Brighter visions beam afar!
Seek the great Desire of nations;
Ye have seen His natal star:
Come and worship!
Worship Christ, the new-born King!

Saints before the altar bending,
Watching long in hope and fear,
Suddenly the Lord, descending,
In His temple shall appear:
Come and worship!
Worship Christ, the new-born King!


30
HARK! the herald angels sing,

HARK! the herald angels sing,
"Glory to the new-born King,
Peace on earth and mercy mild,
God and sinners reconciled!"
Joyful, al! ye nations, rise,
Join the triumph of the skies;
With th' angelic host proclaim,
"Christ is born in Bethlehem."
Hark I the herald angels sing,
"Glory to the new-born King."

Christ, by highest heaven adored,
Christ, the everlasting Lord,
Late in time behold Him come,
Offspring of a virgin's womb;
Veiled in flesh the Godhead see;
Hail th' Incarnate Deity,
Pleased as Man with men to dwell,
Jesus our Immanuel!
Hark! the herald angels sing,
"Glory to the new-born King."

Hail, the heavenly Prince of Peace,
Hail, the Sun of Righteousness.
Light and life to all He brings,
Risen with healing in His wings;
Mild, He Jays His glory by,
Born that man no more may die,
Born to raise the sons of earth,
Born to give them second birth.
Hark! the herald angels sing,
"Glory to the new-born King."


31
OH come, all ye faithful,

OH come, all ye faithful,
Joyful triumphant,
To Bethlehem hasten now with glad accord:
Lo! in a manger
Lies the King of angels;
Oh come, let us adore Him,
Oh come, let us adore Him, Christ the Lord!

Raise, raise, choirs of angels,
Songs of loudest triumph;
Through heaven's high arches
be your praises poured:
Now to our God be Glory in the highest;
Oh come, let us adore Him,
Oh come, let us adore Him, Christ the Lord!

Amen! Lord, we bless Thee,
Born for our salvation;
O Jesus! for ever be Thy name adored;
Word of the Father,
Late in flesh appearing;
Oh come, let us adore Him,
Oh come, let us adore Him, Christ the Lord!


32
ONCE in royal David's city

ONCE in royal David's city
Stood a lowly cattle shed,
Where a mother laid her Baby,
In a manger for His bed.
Mary was that mother mild,
Jesus Christ her little Child.

He came down to earth from heaven,
Who is God and Lord of all,
And His shelter was a stable,
And His cradle was a stall.
With the poor, and mean, and lowly,
Lived on earth our Saviour holy.

And through all His wondrous childhood
He would honour and obey,
Love and watch the lowly mother
In whose gentle arms He lay.
Christian children all must be Mild,
obedient, good as He.

For He is our childhood's pattern,
Day by day like us He grew;
He was little, weak, and helpless,
Tears and smiles like us He knew;
And He fee]eth for our sadness,
And He shareth in our gladness.

And our eyes at 1ast shall see Him,
Through His own redeeming love,
For that Child so dear and gentle
Is our Lord in heaven above;
And He leads His children on
To the place where He is gone.

Not in that poor lowly stable,
With the oxen standing by,
We shall see Him-but in heaven,
Set at God's right hand on high;
When like stars His children crowned,
All in white shall wait around.


33
WHILE shepherds watched their flocks

WHILE shepherds watched their flocks by night,
All seated on the ground;
The angel of the Lord came down,
And glory shone around.

"Fear not!" said he-for mighty dread
Had seized- their troubled mind,­
"Glad tidings of great joy I bring
To you and all mankind.

"To you, in David's town, this day.
Is born of David's line 
The Saviour, who is Christ the Lord;
And this shall be the sign:

"The heavenly Babe you there shall find
To human view displayed,  
All meanly wrapped in swathing bands,
And in a manger laid."

Thus spake the seraph - and forthwith
Appeared a shining throng
Of angels, praising God, who thus
Addressed their joyful song:

"All glory be to God on high!
And to the earth be peace!
Goodwil lhenceforth from heaven to men
Begin, and never cease!" 


34
To us a Child of hope is born,

To us a Child of hope is born,
To us a Son is given;
Him shall the tribes of earth obey,
Him all the hosts of heaven.

His name shall be the Prince of Peace,
For evermore adored,
The Wonderful, the Counsellor,
The great and mighty Lord!

His power, increasing, still shall spread;
His reign no end shall know:
Justice shall guard His throne above,
And peace abound below.


35
THOU didst leave Thy throne and Thy kingly crown,

THOU didst leave Thy throne and Thy kingly crown,
When Thou earnest to earth for me;
But in Bethlehem's home was there found no room
For Thy holy nativity:

c
Oh, come to my heart, Lord Jesus!
There is room in my heart for Thee;
Oh, come to my heart, Lord Jesus, come!
There is room in my heart for Thee.

Heaven's arches rang when the angels sang,
Proclaiming Thy royal degree;
But of lowly birth cam'st Thou, Lord, on earth,
And in great humility:

The foxes found rest, and the birds had their nest
In the shade of the forest tree;
But Thy couch was the sod, O Thou Son of God,
In the deserts of Galilee:

Thou earnest, O Lord, with the living Word
That should set Thy people free;
But with mocking scorn, and with crown of thorn,
They bore Thee to Calvary:

c
Oh come to my heart, Lord Jesus!
Thy cross is my only plea;
Oh come to my heart, Lord Jesus, come!
Thy cross is my only plea.

When heaven's arches shall ring,
and her choirs shall sing
At Thy coming to victory;
Let Thy voice call me home, saying,
"Yet there is room,
There is room at My side for thee!"

c
And my heart shall rejoice, Lord Jesus!
When Thou comest and callest for me.


36
I WILL sing the love of Jesus

I WILL sing the love of Jesus­
Greater love was never known;
Yielding up His life for sinners,
Oh, what Jove to me was shown!

c
I will praise ... my great Redeemer,
As my days ... are on the wing;
I will sing ... of Him who saves me,
I will magnify the Lord my King.

I will sing the words of Jesus­
Words of life from lips Divine;
Full of comfort, joy, and courage,
Precious to this soul of mine.

I will sing the grace of Jesus-.
Grace my heart may now receive;
He by faith will seal my pardon,
If His promise I believe.

I will sing the name of Jesus­
Name of all most dear to me;
By the ransomed host in glory
Shall His name exalted be.


37
SITTING by the wayside, sinful, weak,

SITTING by the wayside, sinful, weak,
and blind,
Waiting in my darkness for the day
O Thou Saviour,Jesus, merciful and kind
Hear me now, and take my sins away!

c
No one knows my sorrow,no one cares for me-
Waiting in the darkness for the day;
Hear a sinner pleading, pleading,
Lord, with thee-
Jesus, come and take my sins away!

Long in darkness waiting, weary, sad, and lone 
How I long Thy glorious face to see!
O Thou blessed Jesus, make me all Thine own;
Speak the word, and Thou canst set me free

Weary with my blindness, waiting all the day,
Weary with my sorrow and my pam;
O Thou Son of David; pass me not, I pray:
Leave me not in hopeless night again!

Sitting by the wayside, sinful, weak, and blind,
Is there any hope for one like me?
Something seems to whisper in my darkened mind,
"Christ has power to set the sinner free."


38
I am so glad that our Father in heaven

I am so glad that our Father in heaven
Tells of His love in the Book He has given:
Wonderful things in the Bible I see;
This is the dearest, that Jesus loves me.

c
I am so glad that Jesus loves me,
Jesus loves me, Jesus loves me,
I am so glad that Jesus loves me,
Jesus loves even me.

Though I forget Him, and wander away,
Still He doth love me wherever I stray;
Back to His dear loving arms do I flee,
When I remember that Jesus loves me.

Oh, if there's only one song I can sing,
When in His beauty I see the great King,
This shall my song in eternity be,
"Oh, what a wonder that Jesus loves me!"

Jesus loves me, and I know I love Him:
Love brought Him down my poor soul
to redeem;
Yes, it was love made Him die on
the tree:
Oh, I am certain that Jesus loves me!

If one should ask of me, howean I tell?
Glory to Jesus, I know very well!
God's Holy Spirit with mine doth agree,
Constantly witnessing—Jesus loves me.

In this assurance I find sweetest rest,
Trusting in Jesus, I know I am blest;
Satan, dismayed, from my soul now
doth flee,
When I just tell him that Jesus
loves me.


39
Tell the glad story of Jesus, who came,

Tell the glad story of Jesus, who came,
Full of compassion, the lost to
re-claim;
Tell of redemption through faith in
His name:
Tell the glad story again!

c
Tell ... it again! ... Tell ... it again! ...
Tell the glad story to suffering man;
Tell it, oh tell it, again!

Tell the glad story where, sad
and opprest,
Many in bondage are sighing for rest;
Tell them in Jesus they all may
be blest:
Tell the glad story again!

Tell the glad story with patience
and love,
Urging the lost ones His mercy
to prove;
Tell them of mansions preparing above:
Tell the glad story again!

Tell the glad story when Jordan's
dark wave
Calleth our loved ones its billows
to brave;
Tell them that Jesus is mighty to save:
Tell the glad story again!


40
Jesus, my Saviour, to Bethlehem came,

Jesus, my Saviour, to Bethlehem came,
Born in a manger to sorrow and shame;
Oh, it was wonderful—blest be His name!
Seeking for me, for me!

c
Seeking for me! for me! . .
Seeking for me! for me! . .
Oh, it was wonderful—blest be His name
Seeking for me, for me

Jesus, my Saviour, on Calvary's tree,
Paid the great debt, and my soul
He set free;
Oh, it was wonderful—how could it be?
Dying for me, for me!

c
Dying for me! for me! . .
Dying for me! for me! . .
Oh, it was wonderful—how could it be?—
Dying for me, for me!

Jesus, my Saviour, the same as of old,
While I was wand'ring afar from
the fold,
Gently and long did He plead with
my soul,
Calling for me, for me!

c
Calling for me! for me! . .
Calling for me! for me! . .
Gentfy and long did He plead with
my soul,
Calling for me, for me!

Jesus, my Saviour, shall come from
on high—
Sweet is the promise as weary
years fly;
Oh, I shall see Him descend from
the sky,
Coming for me, for me!

c
Coming for me! for me! . .
Coming for me! for me! . .
Oh, I shall see Him descend from
the sky,
Coming for me, for me!


41
I have heard of Jesus in Bethlehem

I have heard of Jesus in Bethlehem
born,
Of whom it hath been said,
That a star the wise men followed
from far,
Till they reached His lowly bed.

c
He is my Saviour! This same Jesus
of whom I've heard;
He is my Saviour! I've found
it in His Word.

I have heard of Jesus on
Galilee's wave;
The wind obeyed His will,
And the sea grew calm at hearing
His voice
In the wondrous" Peace, be still!"

I have heard of Jesus at Bethany's
home,
When standing by the grave,
How He cried,"Come forth, O Lazarus,
now!"
In His mighty power to save.

I have heard of Jesus on Calvary's
brow,
He died a Saviour true;—
And He said, "Forgive them, Father,
I pray,
For they know not what they do."

I have heard of Jesus in sepulchre
laid,
In death's dark, sullen gloom;
How He burst the bars, and rising,
came forth,
Mighty Victor from the tomb.


42
There is no love like the love of Jesus,

There is no love like the love of Jesus,
Never to fade or fall,
Till into the fold of the peace of God
He has gathered us all.

c
Jesus' love, precious love,
Boundless and pure and free;
Oh, turn to that love, weary
wandering soul,
Jesus pleadeth for thee.

There is no heart like the heart
of Jesus,
Filled with a tender love;
No throb nor throe that our hearts
can know,
But He feels it above,

Oh, let us hark to the voice of Jesus!
Oh, may we never roam,
Till safe we rest on His loving breast
In the dear heavenly home.


43
Tell me the story of Jesus,

Tell me the story of Jesus,
Write on my heart every word;
Tell me the story most precious,
Sweetest that ever was heard:
Tell how the angels in chorus
Sang, as they welcomed His birth,
"Glory to God in the highest,
Peace and good tidings to earth!"

Fasting alone in the desert,
Tell of the days that He passed;
How for our sins He was tempted,
Yet was triumphant at last:
Tell of the years of His labour,
Tell of the sorrows He bore;
He was despised and rejected,
Homeless, afflicted, and poor.

Tell of the cross where they
nailed Him;
Tell of His anguish and pain;
Tell of the grave where they laid Him,
Tell how He liveth again:
Love, in that story so tender,
Clearer than ever I see:
Glory for ever to Jesus!
He paid the ransom for me.


44
From the Bethlehem manger-home,

From the Bethlehem manger-home,
Walking His dear form beside,
We to Calvary's mount have come,
Where our Lord was crucified.

c
Sweet tones of love come down the
ages through:
"Father, forgive! they know not
what they do."

Scornful words the soldiers fling,
Wicked rulers Him deride,
Saying, "If Thou be the King,
Save Thyself, Thou Crucified!"

Wondrous love for sinful men,
Of the sinless .One that died!
May we wound Thee not again,
Thou, O Christ, the Crucified!


45
'Tis known on earth and heaven too,

'Tis known on earth and heaven too,
'Tis sweet to me because 'tis true;
The" old, old story" is ever new;
Tell me more about Jesus!

c
"Tell me more about Jesus!"
"Tell me more about Jesus!"
Him would I know who loved me so:
"Tell me more about Jesus!"

Earth's fairest flowers will droop
and die,
Dark clouds o'erspread yon azure sky;
Life's dearest joys flit fleetest by;
Tell me more about Jesus!

When overwhelmed with unbelief,
When burdened with a blinding grief
Come kindly then to my relief;
Tell me more about Jesus!

And when the glory-land I see,
And take the" place prepared" for me,
Through endless years my song shall be
"Tell me more about Jesus!"


46
I love to tell the Story

I love to tell the Story
Of unseen things above,
Of Jesus and His glory,
Of Jesus and His love.
I love to tell the Story,
Because I know it's true;
It satisfies my longings
As nothing else can do.

c
I love to tell the Story!
'Twill be my theme in glory,
To tell the Old, Old Story,
Of jesus and His love.

I love to tell the Story:
More wonderful it seems
Than all the golden fancies
Of all our golden dreams.
I love to tell the Story:
It did so much for me;
And that is just the reason
I tell it now to thee.

I love to tell the Story:
Tis pleasant to repeat
What seems, each time I tell it,
More wonderfully sweet.
I love to tell the Story:
For some have never heard
The message of salvation
From God's own Holy Word.

I love to tell the Story:
For those who know it best
Seem hungering and thirsting
To hear it like the rest.
And when, in scenes of glory,
I sing the New, New SONG,
'Twill be the Old, OLD STORY
That I have loved so long.

"NEITHER do I condemn thee!"

"NEITHER do I condemn thee!"—
Oh, words of wondrous grace!
Thy sins were borne upon the cross:
Believe, and go in peace.

c
"Neither do I condemn thee!"
Oh, sing it o'er and o'er:
"Neither do I condemn thee
Go, and sin no more."

"Neither do I condemn thee!"—
For there is therefore now
"No condemnation" for thee,
As at the cross you bow.

"Neither do I condemn thee!-—
I came not to condemn;
I came from God to save thee,
And turn thee from thy sin."

"Neither do I condemn thee!"—
Oh, praise the God of grace!
Oh, praise His Son, our Saviour,
For this His word of peace!


48
Jesus knows thy sorrow,

Jesus knows thy sorrow,
Knows thine every care;
Knows thy deep contrition,
Hears thy feeblest prayer;
Do not fear to trust Him—
Tell Him all thy grief;
Cast on Him thy burden,
He will bring relief.

Trust the heart of Jesus,
Thou art precious there;
Surely He would shield thee
From the tempter's snare;
Safely He would lead thee,
By His own sweet way,
Out into the glory
Of a brighter day.

Jesus knows thy conflict,
Hears thy burdened sigh;
When thy heart is wounded,
Hears thy plaintive cry:
He thy soul will strengthen,
Overcome thy fears;
He will send thee comfort,
Wipe away thy tears.


49
What a blessed hope is mine,

What a blessed hope is mine,
Through the love of Jesus!
I'm an heir of life divine,
Through the love of Jesus!

c
He will my soul defend;
He, my unchanging Friend
He will keep me to the end:
All glory be to Jesus!

I can sing without a fear,
Praise the name of Jesus!
He, my present help, is near,
Praise the name of Jesus!

Pressing on my pilgrim way,
Trusting only Jesus!
Oh, 'tis joy from day to day,
Trusting only Jesus!

Thus my journey I'll pursue,
Looking unto Jesus!
Till the land of rest I view,
There to dwell with Jesus!


50
I met a Stranger fair to see,

I met a Stranger fair to see,
As walked I down life's rugged way;
He spoke so sweet, so tenderly,
He won me to Himself that day.

c
It was the Man ... of Galilee ...
Who whispered words ... of joy
to me: ...
"Thy many sins ... be all forgiven thee,
Thy sins be all ... forgiven thee."

And when that Stranger spoke to me,
My heart threw off its guilty load;
I felt at once that I was free;
I left my burdens by the road.

I love that Stranger since the hour
He talked to me in tender tone;
A joy is mine, I feel its power
And Him as Lord I'm glad to own.


51
Only Jesus feels and knows

ONLY Jesus feels and knows
All the weight of human woes;
Full and free His mercy flows,—
Blessed, blessed Jesus!

c
Oh, that Name we love to hear,
Name above all others dear!
How it calms our every fear!
Blessed, blessed Jesus!

Only Jesus looks within,
Sees our hearts and all our sin;
Only He can make us clean;
Blessed, blessed Jesus!

Only Jesus answers prayer,
Lighter makes the cross we bear,
Bids us cast on Him our care;
Blessed, blessed Jesus!

Safe in Him our souls abide,
Safe His hand our steps will guide,
Till we sing beyond the tide,
"Blessed, blessed Jesus!"


52
Come near me, O my Saviour

COME near me, O my Saviour
Thy tenderness reveal;
Oh, let me know the sympathy
Which Thou for me dost feel!
need Thee every moment;
Thine absence brings dismay;
But when the tempter hurls his darts,
'Twere death with Thee away!

Come near me, my Redeemer,
And never leave my side!
My bark, when tossed on trouble's sea,
The storm cannot outride,
Unless Thy word of power quell;
Arrest the surging wave,
No voice but Thine its rage can
No arm but Thine can save!

Come near me, blessed Jesus!
I need Thee in my joy.
No less than when the direst ills
My happiness destroy;
For when the sun shines o'er me,
And flowers strew my way,
Without Thy wise and guiding hand,
More easily I stray.

Be near me, mighty Saviour,
When comes the latest strife!
For Thou hast through death's
shadows passed,
And ope'd the gates of life;
And when among the ransomed
I stand with crown and palm,
To Thee, Divine, unfailing Friend,
I'll raise th' eternal psalm!


53
Oh where is He that trod the sea?

OH where is He that trod the sea?
Oh where is He that spake,
And demons from their victims flee,
The dead their slumber break?
The palsied rise in freedom strong,
The dumb men talk and sing,
And from blind eyes, benighted long,
Bright beams of morning spring.

Oh where is He that trod the sea?
'Tis only He can save;
To thousands hungering wearily
A wondrous meal He gave:
The Word, who all the worlds had made,
To His own creatures spake;
'Twas spring-tide when He blest
the bread,
And harvest when He brake.

Oh where is He that trod the sea?
My soul, the Lord is here!
Let all thy fears be hushed in thee,
Be thine to know Him near:
Thy utmost needs He'll satisfy:
Art thou diseased or dumb,
Or dost thou in thy hunger cry?
"I come, "saith Christ, "I come!"


54
Come, sing the sweet song of the ages

Come, sing the sweet song of the ages-
The song of Immanuel sing!
There comes through the portals eternal
An anthem of praise to the King!

c
Then loud let our carols of gladness
Re-echo the song of the skies;
Once more to the tidings of glory
The earth in its fulness replies.

Foretold by the word of the prophets;
Decreed by the wisdom of God;
We hail the fulfilment of mercy,
We praise our Redeemer and Lord.

The centuries sing of His coming;
The nations His wonders proclaim;
And ever increasing in glory,
We sing of His wonderful name.

The song that is sweetest and noblest
We sing to the Lord we adore;
And crown Him who comes to redeem us—
Immanuel, King evermore!


55
She only touched the hem of His

She only touched the hem of
His garment
As to His side she stole,
Amid the crowd that gathered
around Him;
And straightway she was whole.

c
Oh, touch the hem of His garment!
And thou, too, shalt be free;
His saving power this very hour
Shall give new life to thee!

She came in fear and trembling
before Him,
She knew her Lord had come;
She felt that from Him virtue had
healed her;
The mighty deed was done.

He turned with" Daughter, be of
good comfort,
Thy faith hath made thee whole!"
And peace that passeth all
understanding
With gladness filled her soul.


56
Like some sweet bird that upward flies,

Like some sweet bird that upward flies,
My soul to heavenly heights would rise,
And while I mount to worlds above,
Would sing of Christ's redeeming love.

c
Redeeming love, ... redeeming love!
The grandest theme, all themes above;
My soul with joy ... her wings
would prove,
And sing of Christ's redeeming love.

Like some sweet flower of spring
that wakes,
When sun and shower its slumber breaks,
My soul would rise from doubt and gloom,
And in His love eternal bloom.

Redeeming love! oh, can it be
That Jesus shed His blood for me?
His glorious name I will adore,
And praise and bless Him evermore.


57
Safe in the arms of Jesus,

Safe in the arms of Jesus,
Safe on His gentle breast,
There by His love o'ershaded,
Sweetly my soul shall rest.
Hark! 'tis the voice of angels
Borne in a song to me,
Over the fields of glory,
Over the jasper sea.

c
Safe in the arms of Jesus,
Safe on His gentle breast;
There by His love o'ershaded,
Sweetly my soul shall rest.

Safe in the arms of Jesus,
Safe from corroding care,
Safe from the world's temptations,
Sin cannot harm me there.
Free from the blight of sorrow,
Free from my doubts and fears;
Only a few more trials,
Only a few more tears.

Jesus, my heart's dear refuge,
Jesus has died for me;
Firm on the Rock of Ages
Ever my trust shall be.
Here let me wait with patience,
Wait till the night is o'er;
Wait till I see the morning
Break on the golden shore.


58
Can it be that Jesus bought

Can it be that Jesus bought
And on the shameful cross atoned
for me,
Loved me, chose me ere I knew Him?
Oh, what a precious, precious
Friend is He!

c
Oh, it is wonderful, very,
very wonderful,
All His grace so rich and free!
Oh, it is wonderful, very,
very wonderful,
All His love and grace to me!

Praise His name, He sought
and found me,
Saved me from wandering and brought
me near;
Freely now His grace bestowing,
Jesus is growing unto me more dear.

Oh, how long He had been waiting,
Waiting the dawning of the precious
hour,
When I should at last be yielding,
Yielding to Jesus every ransomed power.

From that hour He has been seeking
How He may fill me with His precious
love;
How He may through grace transform me,
Meet for the fellowship of saints above.


59
In tenderness He sought me,

In tenderness He sought me,
Weary and sick with sin,
And on His shoulders brought me
Back to His fold again;
While angels in His presence sang
Until the courts of heaven rang.

c
Oh, the love that sought me!
Oh, the blood that bought me!
Oh, the grace that brought me to
the fold!
Wondrous grace that brought me to
the fold!

He found me bruised and dying,
And poured in oil and wine;
He whispered to assure me,
"I've found thee—thou art Mine!"
I never heard a sweeter voice,
It made my aching heart rejoice!

He pointed to the nail-prints,
For me His blood was shed;
A mocking crown so thorny
Was placed upon His head,
I wondered what He saw in me
To suffer such deep agony.

I'm sitting in His presence,
The sunshine of His face,
While with adoring wonder
His blessings I retrace.
It seems as if eternal days
Are far too short to sound His praise.

So while the hours are passing,
All now is perfect rest;
I'm waiting for the morning,
The brightest and the best,
When He will call us to His side,
To be with Him, His spotless Bride.


60
Jesus , the very thought of Thee

Jesus , the very thought of Thee
With sweetness fills my breast;
But sweeter far Thy face to see,
And in Thy presence rest.

Nor voice can sing, nor heart can frame,
Nor can the memory find
A sweeter sound than Thy blest name,
O Saviour of mankind!

Oh, hope of every contrite heart!
Oh, joy of all the meek!
To those who fall, how kind Thou art!
How good to those who seek!

And those who find Thee, find a bliss
Nor tongue nor pen can show;
The love of Jesus, what it is
None but His loved ones know.

Jesus! our only joy be Thou,
As Thou our prize wilt be;
Jesus! be Thou our glory now,
And through eternity.


61
Master, the tempest is raging!

Master, the tempest is raging!
The billows are tossing high!
The sky is o'er-shadowed with blackness,
No shelter or help is nigh:
"Carest Thou not that we perish?"
How canst Thou lie asleep,
When each moment so madly is threatening
A grave in the angry deep?

c
"The winds and the waves shall obey
My will!
Peace! ... be still! ...
Whether the wrath of the storm-tost sea.
Or demons, or men, or whatever it be,
No waters can swallow the ship
where lies
The Master of ocean, and earth,
and skies:
They all shall sweetly obey My will;
Peace! be still! Peace! be still!
They all shall sweetly obey My will;
Peace! peace! be still!"

Master, with anguish of spirit
I bow in my grief to-day;
The depths of my sad heart are troubled;
Oh, waken and save, I pray!
Torrents of sin and of anguish
Sweep o'er my sinking soul;
And I perish! I perish! dear Master:
Oh, hasten, and take control.

Master, the terror is over,
The elements sweetly rest;
Earth's sun in the calm lake
is mirrored,
And heaven's within my breast;
Linger, O blessed Redeemer,
Leave me alone no more:
And with joy I shall make the blest
harbour,
And rest on the blissful shore.


62
He is seeking for the lost,

He is seeking for the lost,
For the lone and tempest-tost,
Hear the tender Shepherd calling day
by day; ...
Over mountain, hill, and plain,
In the sunshine and the rain,
He is seeking for the wanderers
far away.

c
Far away, ... far away, ... He is seeking
for the wanderers gone astray; ...
Over mountain, hill, and plain, in the
sunshine and the rain,
Hear the tender Shepherd celling
day by day.

See His feet, all bleeding, torn,
Pierced with many a cruel thorn,
While He struggles thro' the valleys
chill and lone; ...
But He presses eager on,
All the rocks and caves among,
Ever seeking to reclaim and save
His own.

Oh, the night is closing round,
Have the lost ones all been found?
Are they coming from the mountains
dark and cold? ...
Let us heed the Shepherd's voice,
Let us follow and rejoice,
While He leads us, gently leads us to
the fold.


63
Jesus, Thy boundless love to me

Jesus, Thy boundless love to me
No thought can reach, no tongue declare;
Oh, knit my thankful heart to Thee,
And reign without a rival there!
Thine wholly, Thine alone I am;
Lord, with Thy love my heart inflame.

Oh, grant that nothing in my soul
May dwell, but Thy pure love
alone! Oh, may Thy love possess
me whole—
My joy, my treasure, and my
crown! All coldness from my heart
remove;
May every act, word, thought, be love.

O Love, how cheering is Thy ray!
All pain before Thy presence flies;
Care, anguish, sorrow, melt away,
Where'er Thy healing beams arise;
O Jesus, nothing may I see,
Nothing desire, or seek, but Thee.

In suffering be Thy love my peace;
In weakness be Thy love my power;
And when the storms of life shall cease,
Jesus, in that important hour,
In death, as life, be Thou my Guide,
And save me who for me hast died.


64
Tenderly the shepherd,

Tenderly the shepherd,
O'er the mountains cold,
Goes to bring his lost one
Back to the fold.

c
Seeking to save, seeking to save;
Lost one, 'tis Jesus seeking to save.
Seeking to save, seeking to save;
Lost one, 'tis Jesus seeking to save.

Patiently the owner
Seeks with earnest care,
In the dust and darkness,
Her treasure rare.

Lovingly the father
Sends the news around:
"He once dead now liveth-
Once lost is found."


65
One there is above all others,

One there is above all others,
Oh, how He loves!
His is love beyond a brother's,
Oh, how He loves!
Earthly friends may fail or leave us,
One day soothe, the next day grieve us;
But this Friend will ne'er deceive us,
Oh, how He loves!

Tis eternal life to know Him,
Oh, how He loves!
Think, oh think, how much we owe Him,
Oh, how He loves!
With His precious blood He bought us,
In the wilderness He sought us,
To His fold He safely brought us,
Oh, how He loves!

Blessed Jesus! would you know Him,
Oh, how He loves!
Give yourselves entirely to Him,
Oh, how He loves!
Think no longer of the morrow,
From the past new courage borrow,
Jesus carries all your sorrow:
Oh, how He loves!

All your sins shall be forgiven,
Oh, how He loves!
Backward shall your foes be driven,
Oh, how He loves!
Best of blessings He'll provide you,
Naught but good shall e'er betide you,
Safe to glory He will guide you,
Oh, how He loves!


66
Who is He in yonder stall,

Who is He in yonder stall,
At whose feet the shepherds fall?

c
'Tis the Lord! O wondrous story!
'Tis the Lord, the King of Glory!
At His feet we humbly fall
Crown Him! crown Him Lord of all!

Who is He in deep distress,
Fasting in the wilderness?

Who is He the people bless
For His words of gentleness?

Who is He to whom they bring
All the sick and sorrowing?

Who is He who stands and weeps
At the grave where Lazarus sleeps?

Who is He the gathering throng
Greet with loud triumphant song?

Lo, at midnight, who is He
Prays in dark Gethsemane?

Who is He on yonder tree
Dies in grief and agony?

Who is He who from the grave
Comes to succour, help, and save?

Who is He who from His throne
Rules through all the worlds alone?


67
Hail to the Lord's Anointed,

Hail to the Lord's Anointed,
Great David's greater Son;
Hail in the time appointed,
His reign on earth begun!
He comes to break oppression,
To set the captive free;
To take away transgression,
And rule in equity.

He shall come down like showers
Upon the fruitful earth:
And love, joy, hope, like flowers,
Spring in His path to birth.
Before Him on the mountains
Shall Peace, the herald, go;
And righteousness in fountains
From hill to valley flow.

Kings shall fall down before Him,
And gold and incense bring;
All nations shall adore Him,
His praise all people sing.
For He shall have dominion
O'er river, sea, and shore,
Far as the eagle's pinion
Or dove's light wing can soar.

For Him shall prayer unceasing,
And daily vows ascend;
His kingdom still increasing,
A kingdom without end.
The tide of time shall never
His covenant remove;
His name shall stand for ever,
That name to us is—Love!


68
Did Christ o'er sinners weep

Did Christ o'er sinners weep?
And shall our tears be dry?
Let floods of penitential grief
Burst forth from every eye.

The Son of God in tears
The wondering angels see:
Be thou astonished, O my soul?
He shed those tears for thee.

He wept that we might weep;
Each sin demands a tear:
In heaven alone no sin is found,
And there's no weeping there.


69
I will tell you the wonderful story again,

I will tell you the wonderful
story again,
Of Jesus, the mighty to save;
Who purchased salvation for all
on the cross,
And triumphed o'er death and the grave.
Oh, hear it again, blessed story
of love,
Redemption through Jesus from sin;
He opened the portals of life to
my soul,
And tenderly welcomed me in....

I will tell you the wonderful
story again,
Of pardon to all that believe;
And, oh that the Spirit will help you
just now,
The message of grace to receive!

I will tell you the wonderful
story again,
So precious and dear to my heart;
'Twill give you a comfort the world
cannot give,
A joy it can never impart.

I will tell you the wonderful
story again,
The wonderful story so true:
Oh, haste to the fountain of mercy
divine,
Whose waters are flowing for you.


70
He lives and loves, our Saviour King;

He lives and loves, our Saviour King;
With joyful lips your tribute bring;
Repeat His praise, exalt His Name,
Whose grace and truth are still
the same.

c
His mercy flows, an endless stream,
To all eternity the same;
To all eternity, to all eternity,
To all eternity the same.

His hand is strong, His Word endures,
His sacrifice our peace secures;
From sin and death He doth redeem,
His changeless love be all our theme.

Each day reveals His constant love,
With" mercies new" from heaven above;
Thro' ages past His Word hath stood;
Oh, taste and see that He is good!


71
Oh, precious words that Jesus said!

Oh, precious words that Jesus said!
"The soul that comes to Me.
I will in no wise cast him out,
Whoever he may be."

c
"Whoever he may be,
Whoever he may be;
I will in no wise cast him out,
Whoever he may be."

Oh, precious words that Jesus said!—
"Behold, I am the Door;
And all that enter in by Me
Have life for evermore."

c
"Have life for evermore,
Have life for evermore;
And all that enter in by Me
Have life for evermore."

Oh, precious words that Jesus said!—
"Come, weary souls oppressed,
Come, take My yoke and learn of Me;
And I will give you rest."

c
"And I will give you rest,
And I will give you rest;
Come, take My yoke and learn of Me;
And I will give you rest."

Oh, precious words that Jesus said!—
"The world I overcame;
And they who follow where I lead,
Shall conquer in My name."

c
"Shall conquer in My name,
Shall conquer in My name;
And they who follow where I lead,
Shall conquer in My name."


72
O Thou precious Saviour,

O Thou precious Saviour,
So kind and good to me:
That I might live, Thy blood was shed
On Calvary's cruel tree.

c
O my precious Saviour,
So wonderfully kind!
Should I search the wide world over,
 Icould none like Jesus find.

O Thou precious Saviour,
To whose kind, loving heart
The burdened soul may tell its grief,
And in Thy love have part.

O Thou precious Saviour,
Who suffer'd long for me,
Thy power alone can save from guilt,
From Satan's yoke set free.

O Thou precious Saviour,
Whose love will give the prize,
When life's toils o'er, my soul
wings on
To realms beyond the skies.

O Thou precious Saviour,
Let all my added days
Be spent to serve and honour Thee,
Be spent to bring Thee praise.


73
Oh, sweet is the story of Jesus,

Oh, sweet is the story of Jesus,
The wonderful Saviour of men.
Who suffered and died for the sinner—
I'll tell it again and again!

c
Oh, won derful, wonderful sto - - ry!
The dear - - - est that ever was told;
I'll repeat it in glo - - - ry,
the wonderful sto - - - ry,
Where I . . . shall His beauty behold.

He came from the mansions of glory;
His blood as a ransom He gave
To purchase eternal redemption—
And oh, He is mighty to save!

His mercy flows on like a river;
His love is unmeasured and free;
His grace is for ever sufficient,
It reaches and saves even me.


74
Go and tell Jesus, weary, sin-sick soul!

Go and tell Jesus, weary, sin-sick
soul! soul!
He'll ease thee of thy burden, make
thee whole;
Look up to Him, He only can forgive;
Believe on Him, and thou shalt
surely live.

c
Go and tell Jesus—He only can forgive:
Go and tell Jesus—oh, turn to Him
and live!
Go and tell Jesus! go and tell Jesus!
Go and tell Jesus! He only can forgive.

Go and tell Jesus, when your sins arise
Like mountains of dark guilt before
your eyes:
His blood was shed, His precious life
He gave,
That mercy, peace, and pardon
you might have.

Go and tell Jesus: He'll dispel
thy fears,
Will calm thy doubts, and wipe away
thy tears;
He'll take thee in His arms, and on
His breast
Thou may'st be happy, and for ever
blest.


75
Who came down from heaven to earth?

Who came down from heaven to earth?
Jesus Christ our Saviour!
Came a child of lowly birth?
Jesus Christ our Saviour!

c
Sound the chorus loud and clear—
He hath brought salvation near;
None so precious, none so dear:
Jesus Christ our Saviour!

Who was lifted on the tree?
Jesus Christ our Saviour!
There to ransom you and me?
Jesus Christ our Saviour!

Who hath promised to forgive?
Jesus Christ our Saviour!
Who hath said, "Believe and live"
Jesus Christ our Saviour!

Who is now enthroned above?
Jesus Christ our Saviour!
Whom should we obey and love?
Jesus Christ our Saviour!

Who again from heaven shall come?
Jesus Christ our Saviour!
Take to glory all His own?
Jesus Christ our Saviour!


76
O Love, that passeth knowledge,

O Love, that passeth knowledge,
O Love, whose beams have shone
Through everlasting ages,
From God's eternal throne;
What power Thy depths can fathom?
What tongue can speak Thy worth?
And yet Thou condescendest
To dwell with men on earth.

c
O Love, all love excelling;
Unnumbered hosts are telling,
In yonder blissful dwelling,
What Thou for them hast done.

O Love, that our redemption
Made perfect through the blood
Of Him whose life was offered,
To bring us near to God;
O Love, that now extendeth
A pardon full and free,
And bends with eyes of pity
On sinners such as we.

We give our hearts' devotion,
And grateful thanks we bring,
And lift our hearts and voices,
To praise our Lord and King;
O Love, all thought surpassing,
What will our rapture be,
When, safe beyond the river,
Our souls are lost in Thee!


77
What means this eager, anxious throng,

What means this eager, anxious throng,
Which moves with busy haste along—
These wondrous gatherings day by day:
What means this strange commotion,
pray?
In accents hushed the throng reply,
"Jesus of Nazareth passeth by!"

Who is this Jesus? Why should He
The city move so mightily?
A passing stranger, has He skill
To move the multitude at will?
Again the stirring tones reply,
"Jesus of Nazareth passeth by."

Jesus! 'tis He who once below
Man's pathway trod,'mid pain and woe;
And burdened ones, where'er He came,
Brought out their sick, and deaf, and
lame:
The blind rejoiced to hear the cry,
"Jesus of Nazareth passeth by."

Again He comes! From place to place
His holy footprints we can trace;
He pauseth at our threshold—nay,
He enters—condescends to stay:
Shall we not gladly raise the cry?—
"Jesus of Nazareth passeth by."

Ho! all ye heavy-laden, come!
Here's pardon, comfort, rest, and home;
Ye wanderers from a Father's face,
Return, accept His proffered grace;
Ye tempted ones, there's refuge nigh;
"Jesus of Nazareth passeth by."

But if you still His call refuse,
And all His wondrous love abuse,
Soon will He sadly from you turn,
Your bitter prayer for pardon spurn.
"Too late! too late!" will be
the cry—
"Jesus of Nazareth has passed by."


78
Once I was dead in sin,

Once I was dead in sin,
And hope within me died;
But now I'm dead to sin,
With Jesus crucified.

c
And can it be that" He loved me,
And gave Himself for me"?

O height I cannot reach!
O depth I cannot sound:
O love, O boundless love,
In my Redeemer found!

O cold, ungrateful heart,
That can from Jesus turn,
When living fires of love
Should on His altar burn.

I live—and yet not I,
But Christ that lives in me,
Who from the law of sin
And death hath made me free.


79
At even, ere the sun was set,

At even, ere the sun was set,
The sick, O Lord, around Thee lay;
Oh, in what divers pains they met!
Oh, with what joy they went away!

Once more 'tis eventide, and we,
Oppressed with various ills, draw near
What if Thy form we cannot see!
We know and feel that Thou art here.

O Saviour Christ, our woes dispel!
For some are sick, and some are sad,
And i ome have never loved Thee well,
And some have lost the love they had:

And all, O Lord, crave perfect rest,
And to be wholly free from sin;
And they who fain would serve
Thee best,
Are conscious most of wrong within.

O Saviour Christ, Thou too art man!
Thou hast been troubled, tempted, tried;
Thy kind but searching glance can scan
The very wounds that shame would hide:

Thy touch has still its ancient power;
No word from Thee can fruitless fall:
Hear in this solemn evening hour
And in Thy mercy heal us all.


80
There is love, true love,

There is love, true love, and the
heart grows warm,
When the Lord to Bethany comes;
And the word of life has a wondrous
charm,
When the Lord to Bethany comes.
There is joy, glad joy, and a feast
is spread,
When the Lord to Bethany comes;
For His heavenly voice brings
to life the dead,
When the Lord to Bethany comes.

c
'Twas a happy, happy day in
the olden time,
When the Lord to Bethany came;
Open wide the door, let Him enter now,
For His love is ever the same!
His love is ever the same! ...
His love is ever the same! ...
Open wide the door, let Him enter now!
For His love is ever the same!

There is peace, sweet peace, and the
life grows calm,
When the Lord to Bethany comes;
And the trusting soul sings a sweet,
soft psalm,
When the Lord to Bethany comes.
There is faith, strong faith, and our
home seems near,
When the Lord to Bethany comes;
And the crown more bright, and the
cross more dear,
When the Lord to Bethany comes.

Oh, how dark the night that wrapt

Oh, how dark the night
that wrapt my spirit round!
Oh, how deep the woe my Saviour found
When His blessed sunshine
flooded all my soul,
Bade the darkness vanish:
made me whole!

c
All the way to Calvary
He went for me.
He went for me,
He went for me;
All the way to Calvary
He went for me,
He died to set me free.

Tremblingly a sinner bowed
before His face,
Naught I knew of pardon—nor
His grace;
Heard a voice so tender:
"Cease thy wild regret-
I have bought thy pardon, paid
thy debt."

Oh, 'twas wondrous love
the Saviour showed for me,
When He left His throne for Calvary,
When He trod the winepress,
trod it all alone:
Praise His name for ever—make it known!


83
Blessed Redeemer, full of compassion,

Great is Thy mercy, boundless and free;

Blessed Redeemer, wonderful Saviour,
Fountain of wisdom, Ancient of days,
Hope of the faithful, Light of
all ages,
Jesus, my Saviour, Thee will I praise.

Blessed Redeemer, Thou art my Refuge,
Under Thy watch-care safe I shall be;
Gladly adoring, joyfully trusting,
Still I am coming closer to Thee.

Blessed Redeemer, gracious and tender,
Now and for ever dwell Thou in me;
Thou, my Protector, Shield,
and Defender,
Draw me and keep me closer to Thee.


84
One offer of salvation,

One offer of salvation,
To all the world made known;
The only sure foundation
Is Christ, the Corner-Stone.

c
No other name is given,
No other way is known;
'Tis Jesus Christ,
the First and Last—
He saves, and He alone!

One only door of heaven
Stands open wide to-day;
One sacrifice is given—
'Tis Christ, the Living Way.

My only song and story
Is—Jesus died for me;
My only hope for glory—
The Cross of Calvary.

Friend of sinners! Lord of glory!

Friend of sinners! Lord of glory!
Lowly, mighty, Brother, King!
Musing o'er Thy wondrous story,
Grateful we Thy praises sing.
Friend to help us, cheer us, save us,
In whom power and pity blend-
Praise we must the grace which gave us
Jesus Christ, the sinner's Friend.

Friend who never fails nor grieves us—
Faithful, tender, constant, kind!
Friend who at all times receives us,
Friend who came the lost to find.
Sorrow soothing, joys enhancing,
Loving until life shall end—
Then conferring bliss entrancing,
Still in heaven the sinner's Friend.

Oh to love and serve Thee better!
From all evil set us free;
Break, Lord, every sinful fetter,
Be each thought conformed to Thee.
Looking for Thy bright appearing,
May our spirits upward tend;
Till, no longer doubting, fearing,
We behold the sinner's Friend.

Join all the glorious names

Join all the glorious names
Of wisdom, love, and power,
That mortals ever knew,
That angels ever bore:
All are too mean to speak His worth,
Too mean to set my Saviour forth.

Great Prophet of my God,
My tongue would bless Thy name;
By Thee the joyful news
Of our salvation came:
The joyful news of sins forgiven,
Of hell subdued, and peace with heaven.

Jesus, my great High Priest,
Offered His blood, and died;
My guilty conscience seeks
No sacrifice beside:
His powerful blood did once atone—
And now it pleads before the throne.

My dear Almighty Lord,
My Conqueror and my King!
Thy matchless power and love,
Thy saving grace, I sing:
Thine is the power—oh, may I sit
In willing bonds beneath Thy feet.

Then let my soul arise,
And tread the tempter down;
My Captain leads me forth
To conquest and a crown.
The feeblest saint shall win the day,
Though death and hell obstruct the way.

Should all the hosts of death,
And powers of hell unknown,
Put their most dreadful forms
Of rage and mischief on,
I shall be safe; for Christ displays
Superior power and guardian grace.

Jesus hath ascended—Glory to our King

He who came to save us,
He who bled and died,
Now is crowned with glory
At His Father's side:
Nevermore to suffer,
Nevermore to die,
Jesus, King of Glory,
Is gone up on high.

Praying for His children
In that blessed place,
Calling them to glory,
Sending them His grace;
His bright home preparing,
Little ones, for you,
Jesus ever liveth,
Ever loveth too.

My King of heavenly might.

For He indeed is Lord of lords,
And He the King of kings;
He is the Sun of Righteousness,
With healing in His wings.

Christ is my peace; He died for me,
For me He shed His blood;
And as my wondrous Sacrifice,
Offered Himself to God.

Christ Jesus is my All in All,
My comfort, and my love;
My life below; and He shall be
My joy and crown above.

The precious name of Jesus.

Come, brethren, help me sing His praise.
Oh, praise the name of Jesus!
Come, sisters, all your voices raise,
Oh, bless the name of Jesus!

The children, too, both great and small,
Who love the name of Jesus,
May now accept the gracious call
To work and live for Jesus.

And when to the bright world above
We rise to see our Jesus,
We'll sing around the throne of love
His name, the name of Jesus.

In the night when sorrow clouds me,
And the burning teardrops fall,
Then I sing the song of patience,
Christ, my Brother and my all!

In the day when this immortal
Shall fling off its mortal thrall,
Then my song of resurrection
Shall be—" Christ, my all in all!"

In His name the victory we shall win:
Crown Him for evermore.

He hath spoken, Be still, "the Rebuker

He hath spoken, Be still, "the
Rebuker of seas
The command was for me, and my
heart is at ease;
He hath hushed into silence the waves
and the winds,
By applying His blood and removing
my sins.

c
He's the Prince of Peacemakers,
all glory to God,
To redeem me, and cleanse me,
He shed His own blood;
My adoption is sealed,
I'm a child of the King,
And for ever and ever of Jesus
I'll sing.

He hath quickened my soul by a life
from above;
It was done by the Spirit, its essence
is love,
He hath pardoned and washed me as
white as the snow,
And my heart with His love does this
moment overflow.

He's a wonderful Jesus, this Saviour
of mine;
He's the great Son of God—
a Redeemer Divine;
He's my Strength and my Wisdom,
my Life and my Lord,
And enthroned in my heart to be

There were ninety and nine that

There were ninety and nine that
safely lay
In the shelter of the fold,
But one was out on the hills away,
Far off from the gates of gold—
Away on the mountains wild and bare,
Away from the tender Shepherd's care.

"Lord, Thou hast here Thy ninety
and nine;
Are they not enough for Thee?"
But the Shepherd made answer:
"This of Mine
Has wandered away from Me;
And although the road be rough and steep,
I go to the desert to find My sheep."

But none of the ransomed ever knew
How deep were the waters crossed;
Nor how dark was the night that the
Lord passed through
Ere He found His sheep that was lost.
Out in the desert He heard its cry—
Sick and helpless, and ready to die.

"Lord, whence are those blood-drops
all the way
"That mark out the mountain's track?
"They were shed for one who had
gone astray
Ere the Shepherd could bring him back."
"Lord, whence are Thy hands so rent
and torn?"
"They are pierced to-night by many a
thorn."

But all through the mountains,
thunder-riven,
And up from the rocky steep,
There arose a cry to the gate of heaven,
"Rejoice! I have found My sheep!"
And the angels echoed around the throne,
"Rejoice, for the Lord brings back
His own!"


98
Thou art fairer than the morning,

Thou art fairer than the morning,
O my Saviour and my King!
Of Thy grandeur and Thy beauty,
How my soul delights to sing.

c
Thou art fair - - er than the morning,
Thou art brighter, brighter than the day;
At the glo - - ry of Thy presence
Clouds and darkness flee away.

Clothed in light as with a garment,
Crowned with majesty Divine,
Lo, the sceptre of dominion
Now and ever, Lord, is Thine.

Oh, the greatness of Thy mercy,
And the richness of Thy grace!
Oh, the love that in Thy kingdom
Is preparing me a place!

When the silver cord is broken,
And this mortal life is o'er,
With ten thousand times ten thousand
I shall sing for evermore.


99
Beautiful star of promise,

Beautiful star of promise,
Beautiful morning star;
Beaming with joy and gladness
Over the world afar.

Smile on me, smile on me,
Beautiful, beautiful morning star
Smile on me, smile on me,
Beautiful morning star.

Beautiful star of promise,
Beacon of hope and rest;
Lighting the couch of sorrow,
Soothing the weary breast.

Beautiful star of promise,
Shining when waves are dark;
Into its long-sought haven
Guiding the lonely bark.

Beautiful star of promise,
Star of eternal love;
Thou wilt conduct me safely
Home to the realms above.

In the Rifted Rock I'm resting,

In the Rifted Rock I'm resting,
Sure and safe from all alarm;
Storms and billows have united,
All in vain, to do me harm;
In the Rifted Rock I'm resting,
Surf is dashing at my feet,
Storm-clouds dark are o'er me hovering.
Yet my rest is all complete.

c
In the Rifted Rock I'm resting,
Sure and safe from all alarm:
Storms and billows have united,
All in vain, to do me harm.

Many a stormy sea I've traversed,
Many a tempest-shock have known;
Have been driven, without anchor,
On the barren shore and lone.
Yet I now have found a haven,
Never moved by tempest shock,
Where my soul is safe for ever,
In the blessed Rifted Rock.

Where pastures are blooming and fair . .

And carries them tenderly there; . . .

The weakest His blessings may claim.

"Man of Sorrows, "what a name
For the Son of God, who came
Ruined sinners to reclaim!
Hallelujah! what a Saviour!

Bearing shame and scoffing rude
In my place condemned He stood:
Sealed my pardon with His blood
Hallelujah! what a Saviour!

Guilty, vile, and helpless, we;
Spotless Lamb of God was He:
"Full atonement!"—can it be?
Hallelujah! what a Saviour!

"Lifted up" was He to die,
It is finished!" was His cry
Now in heaven exalted high:
Hallelujah I what a Saviour!

When He comes, our glorious King,
Ail His ransomed home to bring
Then anew this song we'll sing:
Hallelujah! what a Saviour!

Jesus, Thou Refuge of the soul,

Jesus, Thou Refuge of the soul,
To Thy dear arms I flee;
From Satan's wiles, from self and sin,
Oh, make and keep me free.

Though clouds may rise, though
tempests rage,
Thou wilt my shelter be,
While with a steadfast heart and true,
My trust is stayed on Thee.

No power on earth, or power below,
Can tear me from Thy side,
If 'neath Thy sheltering wings of love,
Dear Refuge, I abide.

Not death itself, that last dread foe,
Can hold me with his chain;
Through Christ, who conquered death,
I rise,
And life eternal gain,


106
Dear Refuge of my weary soul,

Dear Refuge of my weary soul,
On Thee, when sorrows rise.
On Thee, when waves of trouble roll,
My fainting hope relies.

To Thee I tell each rising grief,
For Thou alone canst heal;
Thy Word can bring a sweet relief
For every pain I feel.

But oh, when gloomy doubts prevail,
I fear to call Thee mine;
The springs of comfort seem to fail,
And all my hopes decline.

Yet, gracious God, where shad I flee?
Thou art my only trust;
And still my soul would cleave to Thee,
Though prostrate in the dust.

Thy mercy-seat is open still,
Here let my soul retreat;
With humble hope attend Thy will,
And wait beneath Thy feet.


107
Thou dear Redeemer, dying Lamb,

Thou dear Redeemer, dying Lamb,
We love to hear of Thee;
No music's like Thy charming name,
Nor half so sweet can be.
Oh, may we ever hear Thy voice
In mercy to us speak!
And in our Priest we will rejoice,
Thou great Melchisedek.

Our Jesus shall be still our theme
While in the world we stay;
We'll sing our Jesus—lovely name!
When all things else decay.

When we appear in yonder cloud,
With all the ransomed throng,
Then will we sing more sweet,
more loud,
And Christ shall be our song,


108
There is no name so sweet on earth,

There is no name so sweet on earth,
No name so sweet in heaven;
The name before His wondrous birth,
To Christ the Saviour given.

c
We love to sing of Christ our King,
And hail Him blessed Jesus!
For there's no word ear ever heard
So dear, so sweet as" JESUS!"

And when He hung upon the tree,
They wrote this name above Him;
That all might see the reason we
For evermore must love Him.

So now, upon His Father's throne
Almighty to release us
From sin and pains—He ever reigns
The Prince and Saviour, Jesus.

O Jesus, by that matchless Name
Thy grace shall fail us never;
To-day as yesterday the same,
Thou art the same for ever!


109
REST of the weary, joy of the sad;

REST of the weary, joy of the sad;
HOPE of the dreary, light of the glad;
Home of the stranger, strength to
the end;
Refuge from danger, Saviour and Friend.

Pillow where, lying, love rests
its head;
Peace of the dying, life of the dead;
Path of the lowly, prize at the end;
Breath of the holy, Saviour and Friend.

When my feet stumble, to Thee I'll cry,
Crown of the humble, cross of the high;
When my steps wander, over me bend,
Truer and fonder, Saviour and Friend.

Ever confessing Thee, I will raise
Unto Thee blessing, glory, and praise;
All my endeavour, world without end,
Thine to be ever, Saviour and Friend.

The Day-star hath risen, the night-

The Day-star hath risen, the night-
clouds have flown;
No longer in sadness I wander alone;
Its beams in the valley reflected I see:
The Day-star hath risen—it shineth
for me.

c
It shi --- neth for me, ... shi --- neth
for me;
The Day-star hath ris -- en,
it shineth for me...

The Day-star hath risen in beauty
sublime,
To cheer and illumine each
far-distant clime;
The regions in darkness its beauty
shall see:
The Day-star hath risen—it shineth
for me.

The Day-star hath risen, it shineth
for all;
O'er paths that are lonely its
brightness will fall:
O blessed Redeemer, all honour to Thee,
Thou Day-star of glory that shinest
for me!


111
Joy to the world; the Lord is come!

Joy to the world; the Lord is come!
Let earth receive her King;
Let every heart prepare Him room,
And heaven and nature sing.

Joy to the world; the Saviour reigns!
Let men their songs employ;
While fields and floods, rocks, hills,
and plains,
Repeat the sounding joy.

He rules the world with truth and grace;
And makes the nations prove
The glories of His righteousness,
And wonders of His love.


112
How sweet the name of Jesus sounds

How sweet the name of Jesus sounds
In a believer's ear;
It soothes his sorrows, heals
his wounds,
And drives away his fear.

It makes the wounded spirit whole,
And calms the troubled breast;
'Tis manna to the hungry soul,
And to the weary rest.

Dear Name, the Rock on which I build,
My Shield and Hiding-place,
My never-failing Treasury, filled
With boundless stores of grace.

Jesus, my Shepherd, Saviour, Friend,
My Prophet, Priest, and King,
My Lord, my Life, my Way, my End,
Accept the praise I bring.

I would Thy boundless love proclaim
With every fleeting breath;
So shall the music of Thy Name
Refresh my soul in death.


113
Blessed be the Fountain of blood,

Blessed be the Fountain of blood,
To a world of sinners revealed;
Blessed be the dear Son of God:
Only by His stripes we are healed.
Tho' I've wandered far from His fold,
Bringing to my heart pain and woe,
Wash me in the Blood of the Lamb,
And I shall be whiter than snow!

c
Whi - - ter than the snow, . . .
Whi - - ter than the snow, . . .
Wash me in the Blood of the Lamb. ...
And I shall be whiter than snow! ...

Thorny was the crown that He wore,
And the cross His body o'ercame;
Grievous were the sorrows He bore,
But He suffered not thus in vain.
May I to that Fountain be led,
Made to cleanse my sins here below!
Wash me in the Blood that He shed,
And I shall be whiter than snow!

Father, I have wandered from Thee,
Often has my heart gone astray;
Crimson do my sins seem to me—
Water cannot wash them away.
Jesus, to that Fountain of Thine,
Leaning on Thy promise I go;
Cleanse me by Thy washing divine,
And I shall be whiter than snow!


114
Look away to the cross of the Crucified One,

Look away to the cross of the
Crucified One,
Where He purchased salvation for you;
When He laid down His life, and
completed the work
That the Father had sent Him to do.

c
Room at the cross, there is room at
the cross,
And a welcome that all may receive;
There is room at the cross of the
Crucified One,
And redemption for all who believe.

Look away to the cross of the
Crucified One,
To the Cross where He suffered
and bled;
And to-day He invites you to come
if you will,
And be cleansed in the blood that
He shed.

Look away to the cross of the
Crucified One,
Where the wine-press alone He
hath trod;
Where He cried in His anguish,
"Tis finished, 'tis done!
"And commended His spirit to God.

There is life at the cross of the
Crucified One,
And its hope is abiding and sure;
For the rapture that flows from the
love He bestows
Shall for ever and ever endure.


115
When I survey the wondrous cross

When I survey the wondrous cross
On which the Prince of Glory died,
My richest gain I count but loss,
And pour contempt on all my pride.

Forbid it, Lord, that I should boast,
Save in the death of Christ my God:
All the vain things that charm me most,
I sacrifice them to His blood,

See! from His head, His hands, His
feet,
Sorrow and love flow mingled down!
Did e'er such love and sorrow meet,
Or thorns compose so rich a crown?

Were the whole realm of nature mine,
That were an offering far too small:
Love so amazing, so divine,
Demands my soul, my life, my all.


116
On Calvary's brow ... my Saviour died,

On Calvary's brow . . my Saviour died,
"Twas there my Lord . . was crucified:
'Twas on the cross . . He bled for me,
And purchased there . . my pardon free.

c
O Calvary! dark Calvary!
Where Jesus shed His blood for me: ...
O Calvary! blest Calvary!
'Twas there my Saviour died for me.

'Mid rending rocks ... and darkening skies, ...
My Saviour bows ... His head and dies; ...
The opening vail ... reveals the way ...
To heaven's joys ... and endless day.

O Jesus, Lord, . . how can it be, ...
That Thou shouldst give . . Thy life for me?— . .
To bear the cross . . and agony, . .
In that dread hour . . on Calvary!


117
Not all the blood of beasts

Not all the blood of beasts
On Jewish altars slain,
Could give the guilty conscience peace,
Or wash away the stain.

But Christ, the heavenly Lamb,
Takes all our sins away;
A sacrifice of nobler name,
And richer blood than they.

My faith would lay her hand
On that dear head of Thine,
While like a penitent I stand,
And there confess my sin.

My soul looks back to see
The burden Thou didst bear
When hanging on th' accursed tree,
And knows her guilt was there.

"Christ hath redeemed us": sing the glad word!

"Christ hath redeemed us": sing the glad word!
Mercy's sweet message be telling,
How, through the ransom made by His blood,
Christ now within us is dwelling.

"Christ hath redeemed us":
Praise to His name!
Praise Him, ye angels in glory!
"Christ hath redeemed us, "
bearing our shame;
Tell out the wonderful story!

"Christ hath redeemed us, "making
us free,
Free from the sins that enslaved us;
Never in bondage more Can we be,
Trusting in Him who hath saved us.

"Christ hath redeemed us": we are
His own,
Purchased by blood—He will hold us;
Nor will He ever leave us alone,
Safely His arms shall enfold us,

"Christ hath redeemed us": soon
with the throng
Gathered in glory we'll meet Him;
Oh, with what rapture join in the song,
When face to face we shall greet Him!

Christ has for sin atonement made:

Christ has for sin atonement made:
What a wonderful Saviour!
We are redeemed! —the price is paid:
What a wonderful Saviour!

c
What a wonderful Saviour is Jesus,
my Jesus'
What a wonderful Saviour is Jesus,
my Lord!

I praise Him for the cleansing blood:
What a wonderful Saviour!
That reconciled my soul to God:
What a wonderful Saviour!

He cleanses me from all my sin:
What a wonderful Saviour!
And now He reigns and rules within:
What a wonderful Saviour!

He walks beside me in the way:
What a wonderful Saviour!
And keeps me faithful day by day:
What a wonderful Saviour!

He gives me overcoming power:
What a wonderful Saviour!
And triumph in each trying hour:
What a wonderful Saviour!

To Him I've given all my heart:
What a wonderful Saviour!
The world shall never share a part:
What a wonderful Saviour!

Oh, what am I, that I should be

Oh, what am I, that I should be
The object of God's wondrous grace?
That He should send His Son to me,
That I might see Him face to face?

c
It was for me, ... it was for me, ...
For me He left His throne above;
His grace, His goodness all for me, ...
For me the ocean of His love.

That He should give His Son for me,
A sacrifice of love Divine—
Of love as boundless as the sea,
That I might call the Saviour mine?

Oh, wondrous love, that He should
leave
His throne, and come to earth for me!
Should give His life my soul to save,
The ransom pay that sets me free.

A life of service, death of shame,
Ensample true for all, for me—
Oh, shall I not adore His name,
Through time and through eternity.

On yonder hill of Calvary,

On yonder hill of Calvary,
Where Jesus bled and died for me;
'Twas there from sin He set me free,
On Calvary, dark Calvary.

c
On Cal - - vary, dark Calvary,
They nailed my Lord upon the tree—
And there He died in agony,
On Calvary, dark Calvary.

On yonder hill of Calvary,
Behold the world's great tragedy;
The sun that awful hour did flee
From Calvary, dark Calvary.

On yonder hill of Calvary,
The sinner's only hope and plea,
Christ gave Himself for such as we-
On Calvary, dark Calvary.


122
Oh, who is this that cometh

Oh, who is this that cometh
From Edom's crimson plain,
With wounded side, with garments dyed?
Oh, tell me now Thy name,
"I that saw thy soul's distress,
A ransom gave;
I that speak in righteousness,
Mighty to save!"

c
Mighty to save! ...
Mighty to save! . .
Lord, I'll trust Thy wondrous love,
Mighty to save!

Oh, why is Thine apparel
So very deeply dyed?—
Like them that tread
the wine-press red?
Oh, why this crimson tide?
"I the wine-press trod alone,
'Neath darkening skies;
Of the people there was none
Mighty to save!"

O bleeding Lamb, my Saviour,
How couldst Thou bear this shame?
With mercy fraught, Thine arm hath
brought
Salvation in Thy name!
"I the victory have won,
Conquered the grave:
Now the year of joy has come—
Mighty to save!"


123
There is life for a look at the Crucified

There is life for a look at the
Crucified One,
There is life at this moment for thee;
Then, look, sinner, look unto Him
and be saved,
Unto Him who was nailed to the tree.

c
Look! look! look and live!
There is life for a look at the
Crucified One,
There is life at this moment for thee.

Oh, why was He there as the Bearer
of sin,
If on Jesus thy guilt was not laid?
Oh, why from His side flowed the
sin-cleansing blood,
If His dying thy debt has not paid?

It is not thy tears of repentance or
prayers,
But the Blood, that atones for the soul;
On Him, then, who shed it, thou
mayest at once
Thy weight of iniquities roll.

Then doubt not thy welcome, since
God has declared
There remaineth no more to be done;
That once in the end of the world
He appeared,
And completed the work He begun.

Then take with rejoicing from Jesus
at once
The life everlasting He gives;
And know with assurance thou never
canst die,
Since Jesus, thy Righteousness, lives.

Look up! look up! ye weary ones,

Look up! look up! ye weary ones,
Whose skies are veiled in night;
For He who knows the path you tread
Will yet restore the light;
Look up! and hail the dawning
Of hope's triumphant morning.

c
Behold Him! behold Him!
Your Saviour lives to-day;
Behold Him! behold Him!
The clouds have rolled away.

The gifts you bring with loving hand
Your Lord will not disown;
Their odours sweet to heaven shall rise
Like incense round His throne;
Look up! and hail the dawning
Of joy's transcendent morning.

Rejoice! the grave is overcome,
And lo! *he angels sing;
The grandest triumph ever known
Has come through Christ our King;
All heaven proclaims the dawning
Of love's all-glorious morning.

Behold a Fountain deep and wide,

Behold a Fountain deep and wide,
Behold its onward flow;
'Twas opened in the Saviour's side
And cleanseth white as snow,
And cleanseth white as snow!

c
Come to this Fountain!
'Tis flowing to-day;
And all who will may freely come,
And wash their sins away.

From Calvary's cross, where Jesus died
In sorrow, pain, and woe,
Burst forth the wondrous crimson tide
That cleanseth white as snow,
That cleanseth white as snow!

Oh, may we all the healing power
Of that blest Fountain know!
Trust only in the precious blood
That cleanseth white as snow,
That cleanseth white as snow!

And when at last the message comes,
And we are called to go,
Our trust shall still be in the blood
That cleanseth white as snow!

O sacred Head once wounded,

O sacred Head once wounded,
With grief and pain weighed down ,
How scornfully surrounded
With thorns, Thine only crown!
How art Thou pale with anguish,
With sore abuse and scorn!
How does that visage languish,
Which once was bright as mom.

O sacred Head, what glory,
What bliss till now was Thine!
Yet, though despised and gory,
I joy to call Thee mine:
Thy grief and Thy compassion
Were all for sinners' gain;
Mine, mine was the transgression,
But Thine the deadly pain.

What language shall I borrow,
To praise Thee, heavenly Friend,
For this Thy dying sorrow,
Thy pity without end?
Lord, make me Thine for ever,
Nor let me faithless prove;
Oh, let me never, never
Abuse such dying love!

Look, ye saints, the sight is glorious;

Look, ye saints, the sight is glorious;
See the" Man of Sorrows" now
From the fight return victorious:
Every knee to Him shall bow!

Crown Him! crown Him!
Angels, crown Him!
Crown the Saviour" King of kings!"

Crown the Saviour! angels, crown Him!
Rich the trophies Jesus brings:
In the seat of power enthrone Him,
While the vault of heaven rings.

Sinners in derision crowned Him,
Mocking thus the Saviour's claim;
Saints and angels crowd around Him,
Own His title, praise His name.

Hark the bursts of acclamation!
Hark those loud triumphant chords!
Jesus takes the highest station;
Oh, what joy the sight affords!


128
O Christ, what burdens bowed Thy head

O Christ, what burdens bowed Thy head!
Our load was laid on Thee;
Thou stoodest in the sinner's stead,
Didst bear all ill for me.
A Victim led, Thy blood was shed!
Now there's no load for me.

Death and the curse were in our cup:
O Christ, 'twas full for Thee!
But Thou hast drained the last
dark drop,
Tis empty now for me:
That bitter cup, love drank it up,
Now blessing's draught for me.

Jehovah lifted up His rod:
O Christ, it fell on Thee!
Thou wast sore stricken of Thy God;
There's not one stroke for me.
Thy tears. Thy blood, beneath it flowed;
Thy bruising healeth me.

The tempest's awful voice was heard;
O Christ, it broke on Thee!
Thy open bosom was my ward,
It braved the storm for me.
Thy form was scarred, Thy visage marred;
Now cloudless peace for me.

Jehovah bade His sword awake,
O Christ, it woke 'gainst Thee;
Thy blood the flaming blade must
slake,
Thy heart its sheath must be.
All for my sake, my peace to make:
Now sleeps that sword for me.

For me, Lord Jesus, Thou hast died,
And I have died in Thee:
Thou'rt risen—my bands are all untied;
And now Thou liv'st in me;
When purified, made white, and tried,
Thy glory then for me.

There is a fountain filled with blood,

There is a fountain filled with blood,
Drawn from Immanuel's veins,
And sinners plunged beneath that flood
Lose all their guilty stains,

The dying thief rejoiced to see
That fountain in his day;
And there may I, though vile as he,
Wash all my sins away.

E'er since by faith I saw the stream
Thy flowing wounds supply,
Redeeming love has been my theme,
And shall be till I die.
in praise every

Then in a nobler, sweeter song
I'll sing Thy power to save,
When this poor lisping, stammering
tongue
Lies silent in the grave.

March on, march on! sing joyfully,
While the world, into hie awaking,
Hails the bright, bright ray of the glad
Easter Day,
O'er the hills in beauty breaking!

MARCH on, while in praise every
heart we raise
To Him, our King all-glorious,
For He lives on high no more to die,
And shall reign o'er the earth
victorious!

March on, and proclaim our Redeemer's
name,
Who rent the grave asunder,
And the angel eyes that saw Him rise,
How they gazed on the scene with
wonder!

March on, and rejoice with a tuneful
voice,
Ring out a grateful chorus;
To His courts away, oh, haste to-day,
Where the Saviour has gone before us!

My God, I have found the thrice-
blessed ground,
Where life and where joy and true
comfort abound.

c
Hallelujah! Thine the glory!
Hallelujah! Amen.
Hallelujah! Thine the glory! revive
us again!

'Tis found in the blood of Him who
once stood
My refuge and safety, my Surety
with God.

He bore on the tree the sentence
for me,
And now both the Surety and sinner
are free.

Accepted I am in the once-offered
Lamb;
It was God who Himself had devised
the plan.

And though here below, 'mid sorrow
and woe,
My place is in heaven with Jesus, I
know.

And this I shall find, for such is His
mind,
"He'll not be in glory, and leave
me behind."

For soon He will come, and take me
safe home,
And make me to sit with Himself on His
throne.

'Tis midnight: and on Olive's brow

'Tis midnight: and on Olive's brow
The star is dimmed that lately shone;
Tis midnight; in the garden now
The suffering Saviour prays alone.

Tis midnight: and from all removed,
The Saviour wrestles 'lone with fears;
E'en that disciple whom He loved
Heeds not his Master's grief and tears.

Tis midnight: and for others' guilt
The Man of Sorrows weeps in blood;
Yet He, who hath in anguish knelt,
Is not forsaken by His God.

Tis midnight: and from ether-plains
Ts borne the song that angels know;
Unheard by mortals are the strains
That sweetly soothe the Saviour's woe.


133
Thou spotless Lamb of God,

Thou spotless Lamb of God,
On Thee for help I lean;
I know Thy precious blood
Has power to make me clean.
Oh, take my burdened heart,
And wash away its sin;
Thy righteousness impart,
And make me pure within.

I have no hope beside,
I urge no other plea,
Save Thou hast lived and died,
Hast lived and died for me.
Thy pardoning voice I hear,
That tells me I am Thine;
I can no longer fear
Since Thou, O Christ, art mine!

For ever by Thy side
My willing soul would stay;
Be Thou my Guard and Guide
Through life's uncertain day.
No other will I own,
No other name I plead;
Thou didst for sin atone,
And Thou art all I need.


134
Jesus, keep me near the Cross:

Jesus, keep me near the Cross:
There a precious fountain,
Free to all—a healing stream—
Flows from Calvary's mountain.

c
In the Cross, in the Cross, be my glory
ever;
Till my raptured soul shall find rest
beyond the river.

Near the Cross, a trembling soul,
Love and mercy found me;
There the Bright and Morning Star
Shed its beams around me.

Near the Cross! O Lamb of God,
Bring its scenes before me;
Help me walk from day to day,
With its shadow o'er me.

Near the Cross, I'll watch and wait.
Hoping, trusting ever,
Till I reach the golden strand,
Just beyond the river.


135
Rede on! ride on in majesty!

Rede on! ride on in majesty!
Hark! all the tribes hosanna cry!
O Saviour meek, pursue Thy road
With palms and scattered garments
strewed.

c
Ride on! ... ride on ... in ma -- jesty!
In low -- ly pomp ... ride on ... to die!

Ride on! ride on in majesty!
The angel armies of the sky
Look down with sad and wondering eyes.
To see th' approaching Sacrifice,

Ride on! ride on in majesty!
The last and fiercest strife is nigb;
The Father on His sapphire throne
Awaits His own anointed Son.

Ride on! ride on in majesty!
In lowly pomp ride on to die;
Bow Thy meek head to mortal pain,
Then take, O God, Thy power, and
reign.

Enthroned is Jesus now

Enthroned is Jesus now
Upon His heavenly seat;
The kingly crown is on His brow,
The saints are at His feet.

c
There ... with the glorified,
Safe ... by our Saviour's side,
We shall be satisfied by-and-by!
By--- and-by! ... by--- and-by
We shall be satisfied by-and-by!

In shining white they stand,
A great and countless throng;
A palmy sceptre in each hand,
On every lip a song.

They sing the Lamb of God,
Once slain on earth for them;
The Lamb through whose atoning blood
Each wears his diadem.

Thy grace, O Holy Ghost,
Thy blessed help supply,
That we may join that radiant host,
Triumphant in the sky!


137
Lo! a fountain full and free,

Lo! a fountain full and free,
Flowing, ever flowing!
Fainting heart, it is for thee—
Flowing, ever flowing!
Ever sparkling, never still,
Taste its sweetness, all who will.

c
Flowing ever! flowing, ever flowing!
Flowing ever! flowing now for thee!

List the murmur that it speaks,
Flowing, ever flowing!
On the soul in song it breaks,
Flowing, ever flowing!
Singing weary souls to ease—
Music of all melodies.

Blessed fount! the purest known,
Flowing, ever flowing!
Stream of life from out God's throne,
Flowing, ever flowing!
Sacred blood for sinners spilt—
This can cleanse away thy guilt.


138
The blood has always precious been,

The blood has always precious been,
'Tis precious now to me;
Through it alone my soul has rest,
From fear and doubt set free.

c
Oh, wondrous is the crimson tide,
Which from my Saviour flowed!
And still in heaven my song shall be,
"The precious, precious blood!"

"I will remember now no more"—
God's faithful Word has said—
"The follies and the sins of him
For whom My Son has bled."

Not all my well-remembered sins
Can startle or dismay:
That precious blood atones for all,
And bears my guilt away.

Perhaps this feeble frame of mine
Will soon in sickness lie;
But, resting on that precious blood,
How peacefully I'll die!


139
Beneath the Cross of Jesus

Beneath the Cross of Jesus
I fain would take my stand—
The shadow of a mighty Rock
Within a weary land;
A home within the wilderness,
A rest upon the way,
From the burning of the noontide heat,
And the burden of the day.

O safe and happy shelter,
O refuge tried and sweet,
O trysting place, where Heaven's love
And Heaven's justice meet!
As to the holy patriarch
That wondrous dream was given,
So seems my Saviour's cross to me
A ladder up to heaven.

There lies beneath its shadow,
But on the farther side,
The darkness of an awful grave
That gapes both deep and wide;
And there between us stands the cross,
Two arms outstretched to save,
Like a watchman set to guard the way
From that eternal grave.

Upon that cross of Jesus
Mine eye at times can see
The very dying form of One
Who suffered there for me;
And from my smitten heart, with tears,
Two wonders I confess—
The wonder of His glorious love,
And my own worthlessness.

I take, O cross, thy shadow
For my abiding place;
I ask no other sunshine than
The sunshine of His face:
Content to let the world go by,
To know no gain nor loss—
My sinful self my only shame,
My glory all the cross.


140
All ye that pass by,

All ye that pass by,
To Jesus draw nigh;
To you is it nothing
That Jesus should die?
Your ransom and peace,
Your surety He is,
Come, see if there ever
Was sorrow like His.

For what you have done
His blood must atone:
The Father hath punished
For you His dear Son:
The Lord, in the day
Of His anger did lay
Your sins on the Lamb,
And He bore them away.

He died to atone
For sins not His own;
Your debt He hath paid
And your work He hath done:
Ye all may receive
The peace He did leave,
Who made intercession,
"My Father, forgive!"

For you and for me
He prayed on the tree;
The prayer is accepted,
The sinner is free;
The sinner am I,
Who on Jesus rely,
And come for the pardon
God cannot deny.

His death is my plea;
My Advocate see,
And hear the blood speak
That hath answered for me:
He purchased the grace
Which now I embrace;
O Father, Thou know'st
He hath died in my place!


141
The head that once was crowned with

The head that once was crowned with
thorns
Is crowned with glory now:
A royal diadem adorns
The mighty Victor's brow.

The highest place that heaven affords
Is His by sovereign right:
The King of kings, and Lord of lords,
He reigns in perfect light.

The joy of all who dwell above,
The joy of all below,
To whom He manifests His love,
And grants His name to know.

To them the cross, with all its shame,
With all its grace, is given:
Their name, an everlasting name;
Their joy, the joy of heaven.

They suffer with their Lord below,
They reign with Him above;
Their profit and their bliss to know
The fulness of His love.

His cross to them is life and health,
Though it was death to Him;
Their present hope, and joy, and wealth,
And their eternal theme.


142
Nothing either great or small—

Nothing either great or small—
Nothing, sinner, no;
Jesus did it, did it all,
Long, long ago.

c
"It is finished!" yes, indeed,
Finished every jot:
Sinner, this is all you need—
Tell me, is it not?

When He, from His lofty throne,
Stooped to do and die.
Everything was fully done:
Hearken to His cry.

Weary, working, burdened one,
Wherefore toil you so?
Cease your doing; all was done
Long, long ago.

Till to Jesus' work you cling
By a simple faith,
"Doing" is a deadly thing—
"Doing" ends in death.

Cast your deadly" doing" down—
Down at Jesus' feet;
Stand in Him, in Him alone,
Gloriously complete.


143
Free from the law, oh, happy

Free from the law, oh, happy condition!
Jesus hath bled, and there is remission!
Cursed by the law, and bruised
by the fall,

c
Grace hath redeemed us once for all.
Once for all, O sinner, receive it;
Once for all, O brother, believe it:
Cling to the Cross, the burden
will fall;
Christ hath redeemed us once for all.

Now are we free-there's no condemnation,
Jesus provides a perfect salvation;
Come unto Me"—oh, hear His
sweet call,
Come, and He saves us once for all.

"Children of God!" oh, glorious
calling!
Surely His grace will keep us from
falling;
Passing from death to life at His call,
Blessed salvation once for all.


144
When God of old the way of life

When God of old the way of life
Would teach to all His own,
He placed them safe beyond the reach
Of death, by blood alone.

c
It is His word, God's precious word,
It stands for ever true:
"When I the Lord shall see the blood,
I will pass over you."

By Christ, the sinless Lamb of God,
The precious blood was shed,
When He fulfilled God's holy Word,
And suffered in our stead.

O soul, for thee salvation thus
By God is freely given;
The blood of Christ atones for sin,
And makes us meet for heaven.

The wrath of God that was our due,
Upon the Lamb was laid;
And by the shedding of His blood
The debt for us was paid.

How calm the judgment hour shall pass
To all who do obey
The Word of God, and trust the blood,
And make that Word their stay!


145
Would you be free from your burden

Would you be free from your burden
of sin?
There's power in the blood, power
in the blood;
Would you o'er evil a victory win?
There's wonderful power in the blood.

c
There is power, . . . power, wonder-
working power
In the blood ... of the Lamb; ...
There is power, ... power, wonder-
working power
In the precious blood of the Lamb.

Would you be free from your passion
and pride?
There's power in the blood, power
in the blood;
Come for a cleansing to Calvary's
tide,
There's wonderful power in the blood.

Would you be whiter, much whiter
than snow?
There's power in the blood, power
in the blood;
Sin-stains are lost in its life-
giving flow,
There's wonderful power in the blood.

Would you do service for Jesus your
King?
There's power in the blood, power
in the blood;
Would you live daily His praises to
sing?
There's wonderful power in the blood.


146
Behold, the Easter-tide is here,

Behold, the Easter-tide is here,
With Easter joy and bloom:
Behold, the stone is rolled away,
To show a conquered tomb.

c
Jesus is risen, as He said—
Risen in triumph from the grave!
Rejoice and sing on this Easter-tide—
Jesus is risen, mighty to save!

Behold, the vestures of the dead,
All folded back with care:
Behold, the dark and vacant tomb,
For Jesus is not there.

Behold, He walks the earth again,
Exalted in His love:
Behold, the glory on His brow,
Reflected from above.

Behold, the Easter-tide is here,
With Easter song and word:
Behold, amid these Easter gifts,
The triumph of the Lord.


147
The Lord of glory! who is He?

The Lord of glory! who is He?
Who is the King of glory?
Only the Son of God can be
The Christ, the King of glory:
Consider all His wounds, and see
How Jesus' death upon the tree
Proclaims Him King of glory.

Above all heavens, at God's right
hand,
Now sits the King of glory;
The angels by His favour stand
Before the throne of glory:
Swiftly they fly at His command,
To guard His own of every land.
To keep the heirs of glory.

Death and the grave confess the Lamb
To be the King of glory;
The powers of darkness dread His name,
All creatures show His glory:
He said, "Ere Abraham was I AM"—
Jesus is evermore the same,
Th' Almighty King of glory.

Thrice happy who in Him believe,
They soon will share His glory;
Bora of His Spirit, they receive
His secret pledge of glory:
Taught by His cross, for sin
they grieve;
He calls them brethren, and they cleave
To Him, their hope of glory,


148
Soft and sweet the bells are ringing

Soft and sweet the bells are ringing
From the steeple old and grey;
Sweet and soft the children singing-
Christ the Lord arose to-day!

c
Sweetly, softly sounds the anthem,
For the stone is rolled away;
Glory, honour give to Jesus
On this resurrection day!

Sweeter far than earthly music
Since the Christmas melody,
Is this song of Easter glory,
This glad psalm of victory.

Love's redeeming work is finished,
Fought the fight, the victory won;
Glory, glory in the highest!
To the Father and the Son.

Hark! ten thousand harps and voices

Hark! ten thousand harps and voices
Sound the note of praise above;
Jesus reigns, and heaven rejoices;
Jesus reigns, the God of love:
See, He sits on yonder throne;
Jesus rules the world alone.
Hallelujah! hallelujah!
Jesus rules the world alone.

King of glory! reign for ever—
Thine an everlasting crown;
Nothing from Thy love shall sever
Those whom Thou hast made Thine own;—
Happy objects of Thy grace,
Destined to behold Thy face.
Hallelujah! hallelujah!
Destined to behold Thy face.

Saviour! hasten Thine appearing;
Bring, oh bring the glorious day,
When the awful summons hearing,
Heaven and earth shall pass away;
Then, with golden harps we'll sing,
"Glory, glory to our King!
Hallelujah! hallelujah!
Glory, glory to our King!"


150
Jesus lives, and Jesus leads,

Jesus lives, and Jesus leads,
Though the way be dreary;
Morn to darkest night succeeds,
Courage, then, ye weary:
Still the faithful Shepherd feeds;
Jesus lives, and Jesus leads.

All the words He ever spoke,
Still to us He speaketh;
All the bread He ever broke,
Still for us He breaketh:
Still the faithful Shepherd feeds;
Jesus lives, and Jesus leads.

Jesus lives, but Jesus died;
Love to death consigned Him:
Death the mighty Love resigned,
Could not hold or bind Him:
Therefore still He meets our needs;
Jesus lives, and Jesus leads.

Jesus lives, and every grace
Comes because He giveth;
Life and love in every place
Live, for Jesus liveth:
All our thoughts His love exceeds;
Jesus lives, and Jesus leads.

Yes, if Jesus lives, He leads—
He will not forsake us;
He will crown His gracious deeds,
And to glory take us:
Till that hour the Shepherd feeds;
Jesus lives, and Jesus leads.


151
Behold the Saviour of mankind

Behold the Saviour of mankind
Nailed to the shameful tree;
How vast the love that Him inclined
To bleed and die for thee!

Hark, how He groans, while nature
shakes,
And earth's strong pillars bend;
The temple's vail in sunder breaks,
The solid marbles rend.

Tis done! the precious ransom's paid;
"Receive My soul!" He cries;
See where He bows His sacred head—
He bows His head and dies.

But soon He'll break death's
envious chain,
And in full glory shine:
O Lamb of God, was ever pain,
Was ever love, like Thine?


152
Low in the grave He lay—

Low in the grave He lay—
Jesus, my Saviour!
Waiting the coming day—
Jesus, my Lord!

c
Up from the grave He arose,
With a mighty triumph o'er His foes;
He arose a Victor from the dark domain,
And He lives for ever with His saints
to reign:
He arose! . . . He arose! . ...
Hallelujah! Christ arose!

Vainly they watch His bed—
Jesus, my Saviour!
Vainly they seal the dead—
Jesus, my Lord!

Death cannot keep his prey—
Jesus, my Saviour!
He tore the bars away—
Jesus, my Lord!


153
Hallelujah! hallelujah! Hearts to heaven

Hallelujah! hallelujah!
Hearts to heaven and voices raise; ...
Sing to God a hymn of gladness,
Sing to God a hymn of praise; ...
He who on the cross a victim
For the world's salvation bled,
Jesus Christ, the King of glory,
Now is risen from the dead.

Christ is risen, Christ the first-fruits
Of the holy harvest-field; . . .
Which will all its full abundance
At His glorious advent yield; . . .
Then the golden ears of harvest
Will their heads before Him wave,
Ripened by His glorious sunshine
From the furrows of the grave.

Hallelujah! hallelujah!
Glory be to God on high! . . .
Hallelujah to the Saviour,
Who has gained the victory; . . .
Hallelujah to the Spirit;
Let our high ascriptions be,
Hallelujah, now and ever,
To the blessed Trinity!


154
Arise, my soul, arise!

Arise, my soul, arise!
Shake off thy guilty fears;
The bleeding Sacrifice
In my behalf appears.
Before the throne my Surety stands;
My name is written on His hands.

He ever lives above,
For me to intercede,
His all-redeeming love,
His precious blood to plead;
His blood atoned for all our race,
And sprinkles now the throne of grace.

Five bleeding wounds He bears,
Received on Calvary;
They pour effectual prayers,
They strongly plead for me:
"Forgive him, oh, forgive!" they cry,
"Nor let that ransomed sinner die."

My God is reconciled;
His pardoning voice I hear:
He owns me for His child;
I can no longer fear:
With confidence I now draw nigh,
And" Father, Abba Father!" cry.


155
Rejoice, the Lord is King!

Rejoice, the Lord is King!
Your God and King adore;
Mortals, give thanks and sing,
And triumph evermore:
Lift up the heart, lift up the voice:
Rejoice aloud, ye saints, rejoice!

Rejoice! the Saviour reigns—
The God of truth and love;
When He had purged our stains,
He took His seat above:
Lift up the heart, lift up the voice:
Rejoice aloud, ye saints, rejoice!

He all His foes shall quell,
Shall all our sins destroy;
And every bosom swell
With pure, seraphic joy;
Lift up the heart, lift up the voice:
Rejoice aloud, ye saints, rejoice!

Rejoice in glorious hope!
Jesus, the Judge, shall come,
And take His servants up
To their eternal home:
We soon shall hear th' archangel's
voice:
The trump of God shall sound:
Rejoice!


156
Christ hath risen! Hallelujah!

Christ hath risen! Hallelujah!
Blessed morn of life and light!
Lo. the grave is rent asunder,
Death is conquered through His might.

c
Christ is risen! Hallelujah!
Gladness fills the world to-day;
From the tomb that could not hold Him,
See, the stone is rolled away!

Christ hath risen! Hallelujah!
Friends of Jesus, dry your tears;
Through the vail of gloom and darkness.
Lo, the Son of God appears!

Christ hath risen! Hallelujah!
He hath risen, as He said;
He is now the King of glory,
And our great exalted Head.


157
Hallelujah, "He is risen!"

Hallelujah, "He is risen!"
Jesus is gone up on high!
Burst the bars of death asunder;
Angels, shout; and men, reply:
He is risen, He is risen,
Living now, no more to die.

Hallelujah, He is risen!
Our exalted Head to be;
Sends the witness of the Spirit
That our Advocate is He:
He is risen, He is risen,
Justified in Him are we.

Hallelujah, He is risen!
Death for aye has lost his sting;
Christ, Himself the Resurrection,
From the grave His own will bring:
He is risen, He is risen,
Living Lord and coming King.


158
"Christ the Lord is risen to-day!"

"Christ the Lord is risen to-day!"
 Hallelujah!
Sons of men and angels say;
 Hallelujah!
Raise your joy and triumph high,
 Hallelujah!
Sing, ye heavens! and earth, reply:
 Hallelujah!

Love's redeeming work is done:
Fought the fight, the battle won:
Lo! our Sun's eclipse is o'er;
Lo! He sets in blood no more:

Vain the stone, the watch, the seal,
Christ hath burst the gates of hell;
Death in vain forbids His rise,
Christ hath opened Paradise:

Lives again our glorious King;
Where, O death, is now thy sting?
Once He died our souls to save;
Where's thy victory, boasting grave?

King of glory! Soul of bliss!
Everlasting life is this:
Thee to know, Thy power to prove,
Thus to sing, and thus to love:


159
ON that bright and golden morning

ON that bright and golden morning
when the Son of Man shall come,
And the radiance of His glory we
shall see;
When from every clime and nation
He shall call His people home—
What a gath'ring of the ransomed
that will be!

c
What a gath' ring! what a gath' ring!
What a gath'ring of the ransomed in the
summer land of love!
What a gath' ring! what a gath'ring
Of the ransomed in that happy
home above!

When the blest who sleep in Jesus at
His bidding shall arise
From the silence of the grave, and
from the sea;
And with bodies all celestial they
shall meet Him in the skies—
What a gath'ring and rejoicing
there will be!

When our eyes behold the City, with
its" many mansions" bright,
And its river, calm and restful,
flowing free—
When the friends that death has
parted shall in bliss again unite—
What a gath'ring and a greeting
there will be!

Oh, the King is surely coming, and
the time is drawing nigh,
When the blessed day of promise
we shall see;
Then the changing" in a moment,"
"in the twinkling of an eye,"
And for ever in His presence we
shall be.


160
They come and go, the seasons fair,

They come and go, the seasons fair,
And bring their spoil to vale and hills;
But oh, there is waiting in the air,
And a passionate hope the spirit fills.
Why doth He tarry, the absent Lord?
When shall the Kingdom be restored.
And earth and heaven with one accord,
Ring out the cry that the King comes?

c
What will it be when the King comes!
What will it be when the King comes!
What will it be when He comes! . .
What will it be when the King comes!

The floods have lifted up their voice;
The King hath come to His own—
His own!
The little hills and vales rejoice,
His right it is to take the crown.
Sleepers, awake, and meet Him first!
Now let the marriage hymn outburst!
And powers of darkness flee, dis-perst—
What will it be when the King comes!

A ransomed earth breaks forth in song,
Her sin-stained ages over-past;
Her yearning, "Lord, how long, how
long?
"Exchanged for joy at last—at last!
Angels, carry the royal commands;
Peace beams forth throughout all the lands:
The trees of the field shall clap their hands—
What will it be when the King comes!

Now Zion's hill, with glory crowned,
Uplifts her head with joy once more;
And Zion's King, once scorned,disowned,
Extends her rule from shore to shore.
Sing, for the land her Lord regains!
Sing, for the Son of David reigns!
And living streams o'erflow her plains—
What will it be when the King comes!

O brothers, stand as men that wait,
The dawn is purpling in the east,
And banners wave from heaven's high gate;
The conflict now—but soon the feast.
Mercy and truth shall meet again;
Worthy the Lamb that once was slain;
We can suffer now—He will know us then—
What will it be when the King comes!


161
He comes with clouds descending,

He comes with clouds descending,
Once for favoured sinners slain;
Thousand thousand saints attending,
Swell the triumph of His train;
Hallelujah!
Jesus comes, and comes to reign!

Every eye shall now behold Him,
Robed in dreadful majesty;
Those who set at naught and sold Him,
Pierced and nailed Him to the tree.
Deeply wailing,
Shall the true Messiah see.

When the solemn trump has sounded,
Heaven and earth shall flee away;
All who hate Him must, confounded,
Hear the summons of that day—
Come to Judgment!
Come to Judgment, come away!

Now redemption, long expected,
See in solemn pomp appear!
All His saints, by men rejected,
Now shall meet Him in the air:
Hallelujah!
See the day of God appear!

Yea, Amen! let all adore Thee,
High on Thine eternal throne;
Saviour, take the power and glory,
Claim the kingdom for Thine own!
Oh, come quickly!
Hallelujah! come, Lord, come!



162
Christ is coming! let creation

Christ is coming! let creation
From her groans and travail cease;
Let the glorious proclamation
Hope restore and faith increase:

c
Christ is coming I Christ is coming!
Come, Thou blessed Prince of Peace!
Christ is coming! Christ is coming!
Come, Thou blessed Prince of Peace!

Earth can now but tell the story
Of Thy bitter cross and pain;
She shall yet behold Thy glory
When Thou comest back to reign.

Though once cradled in a manger,
Oft no pillow but the sod;
Here an alien and a stranger,
Mocked of men, disowned of God:

Long Thy exiles have been pining,
Far from rest, and home, and Thee;
But, in heavenly vesture shining,
Soon they shall Thy glory see.

With that "blessed hope" before us,
Let no harp remain unstrung;
Let the mighty ransomed chorus
Onward roll from tongue to tongue.


163
It may be at morn, when the day is awaking,

It may be at morn, when the day is
awaking,
When sunlight through darkness and
shadow is breaking,
That Jesus will come in the fulness
of glory,
To receive from the world" His own."

c
O Lord Jesus, how long?
How long ere we shout the glad song?—
Christ returneth! Hallelujah!
Hallelujah! Amen!
Hallelujah! Amen!

It may be at midday, it may be at
twilight,
It may be, perchance, that the
blackness of midnight
Will burst into light in the blaze of
His glory,
When Jesus receives" His own."

While hosts cry Hosanna, from
heaven descending.
With glorified saints and the angels
attending,
With grace on His brow, like a halo
of glory,
Will Jesus receive" His own."

Oh, joy! oh, delight! should we go
without dying;
No sickness, no sadness, no dread,
and no crying;
Caught up through the clouds with
our Lord into glory,
When Jesus receives" His own."


164
Rejoice! Rejoice! our King is coming

Rejoice! Rejoice! our King is coming!
And the time will not be long,
Until we hail the radiant dawning,
And lift up the glad new song.

c
Oh, wondrous day!oh, glorious morning,
When the Son of Man shall come!
May we with lamps all trimmed
and burning
Gladly welcome His return!
Rejoice! Rejoice! our King is coming!
And the time will not be long,
Until we hail the radiant dawning,
And lift up the glad new song.

With joy we wait our King's returning
From His heavenly mansions fair;
And with ten thousand saints appearing,
We shall meet Him in the air.

Oh, may we never weary, watching,
Never lay our armour down,
Until He come, and with rejoicing
Give to each the promised crown.


165
Our lamps are trimmed and burning,

Our lamps are trimmed and burning,
Our robes are white and clean,
We've tarried for the Bridegroom,
Oh, may we enter in?
We know we've nothing worthy
That we can call our own:
The light, the oil, the robes we wear,
All come from Him alone.

c
Behold, the Bridegroom cometh
And all may enter in,
Whose lamps are trimmed and burning;
Whose robes are white and clean.

Go forth, go forth to meet Him!
The way is open now,
All lighted with the glory
That's streaming from His brow
Accept the invitation,
Beyond deserving kind;
Make no delay, but take your lamps,
And joy eternal find.

We see the marriage splendour
Within the open door;
We know that those who enter
Are blest for evermore.
We see He is more lovely
Than all the sons of men,
But still we know the door, once shut,
Will never ope again.


166
When Jesus shall gather the nations

When Jesus shall gather the nations
Before Him at last to appear,
Oh, how shall we stand in the Judgment,
When summoned our sentence to hear?

c
He will gather the wheat in His garner,
But the chaff will He scatter away;
Then how shall we stand in the Judgment—
Oh, how shall we stand in that day?

Shall we hear from the lips of the
Saviour
The words, *' Faithful servant,
well done!"
Or, trembling with fear and with
anguish,
Be banished away from is throne?

Then let us be watching and waiting—
Our lamps burning steady and bright—
That when we are called by the
Bridegroom,
We'll answer the call with delight.

Thus living with hearts fixed on Jesus,
In patience we wait for the time
When the days of our pilgrimage ended,
We'll rest in His presence divine.


167
Do you see the Hebrew captive kneeling,

Do you see the Hebrew captive kneeling,
At morning, noon, and night, to pray?
In his chamber he remembers Zion,
Though in exile far away.

c
Are your windows open toward Jerusalem,
Though as captives here a
"little while" we stay?
For the coming of the King in
His glory,
Are you watching day by day?

Do not fear to tread the fiery furnace,
Nor shrink the lions' den to share;
For the God of Daniel will deliver,
He will send His angel there.

Children of the living God,
take courage,
Your great deliverance sweetly sing;
Set your faces toward the hill of Zion.
Thence to hail your coming King!


168
There's a glorious Kingdom waiting

There's a glorious Kingdom waiting
in the land beyond the sky,
Where the saints have been gathering
year by year;
And the days are swiftly passing that
will bring the Kingdom nigh:
For the coming of the Kingdom
draweth near!

c
Oh, the coming of the Kingdom draweth
near! . . .
Oh, the coming of the Kingdom draweth
near! . . .
Be thou ready, O my soul,
for the trumpet
soon may roll, And the King in
His glory shall appear

Tis the hope of yonder Kingdom, and
the glory there prepared,
And the looking for the Saviour to
appear,
That delivers us from bondage to the
world that once ensnared:
For the coming of the Kingdom
draweth near!

With the coming of the Kingdom we
shall see our blessed Lord,
For the King ere the Kingdom
must appear,
Hallelujah to His name, who redeemed
us by His blood!
Oh, the coming of the Kingdom
draweth near!

Oh, the world is growing weary, it
has waited now so long,
And the hearts of men are failing
them for fear;
Let us tell them of the Kingdom, let
us cheer them with the song,
That the coming of the Kingdom
draweth near!


169
A better day is coming,

A BETTER day is coming,
A morning promised long,
When girded Right, with holy Might,
Will overthrow the Wrong;
When God the Lord will listen
To every plaintive sigh,
And stretch His hand o'er every land,
With justice by and by.

c
Coming by and by, coming by and by!
The better day is coming,
the morning draweth nigh
Coming by and by, coming by and by!
The welcome dawn will hasten on,
'tis coming by and by.

The boast of haughty Error
No more will fill the air,
But Age and Youth will love the Truth,
And spread it everywhere;
No more from Want and Sorrow
Will come the hopeless cry;
For strife will cease, and perfect
Peace
Will flourish by and by.

Oh, for that holy dawning
We watch, and wait, and pray,
Till o'er the height the morning light
Shall drive the gloom away;
And when the heavenly glory
Shall flood the earth and sky,
We'll bless the Lord for all His word,
And praise Him by and by.


170
We are waiting, blessed Saviour,

We are waiting, blessed Saviour,
We are watching for the hour
When in majesty descending,
Thou shalt come in mighty power;
Then the shadows will be lifted,
And the darkness rolled away,
And our eyes behold the splendour
Of the glorious crowning-day.

We are waiting, blessed Saviour,
We are watching not in vain
For the cloud that bore Thee upward,
And will bring Thee back again;
Then, among Thy ransomed people,
We shall tread the shining way,
And our eyes behold the splendour
Of the glorious crowning-day.

We are waiting, blessed Saviour,
For a union, heart to heart.
With our dear ones o'er the river,
Where we nevermore shall part;
Then our sorrows, in a moment,
Like a dream will pass away
When our eyes behold the splendour
Of the glorious crowning-day.


171
He dies! He dies! the lowly Man of Sorrows,

He dies! He dies! the lowly
Man of Sorrows,
On whom were laid our many griefs
and woes;
Our sins He bore, beneath God's
awful billows,
And He hath triumphed over all
our foes.

c
"I am He that liveth, that liveth,
and was dead;
I am He that liveth, that liveth,
and was dead;
And behold, ... I am alive ...
for evermore,..
Behold, ... I am alive ... for evermore.
I am He that liveth, that liveth,
and was dead;
And behold, ... I am alive ...
for evermore..

He lives! He lives! what glorious
consolation!
Exalted at His Father's own
right hand;
He pleads for us, and by
His intercession,
Enables all His saints by grace
to stand.

He comes! He comes! Oh, blest
anticipation!
In keeping with His true and
faithful word;
To call us to our heavenly
consummation-
Caught up, to be"for ever with
the Lord.


172
He is coming, the" Man of Sorrows,"

He is coming, the" Man of Sorrows,"
Now exalted on high;
He is coming with loud hosannas,
In the clouds of the sky.

c
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
He is coming again;
And with joy we will gather round Him,
At His coming to reign!

He is coming, our loving Saviour,
Blessed Lamb that was slain!
In the glory of God the Father,
On the earth He shall reign.

He is coming, our Lord and Master,
Our Redeemer and King;
We shall see Him in all His beauty,
And His praise we shall sing.

He shall gather His chosen people,
Who are called by His name;
And the ransomed of every nation,
For His own He shall claim.


173
There's a light that is shining

There's a light that is shining
in darkness,
While we wait for the dawning of day;
And it cheers us along on our journey,
Till the shadows shall vanish away!

c
So we'll wait and watch for
the dawning,
The day of eternity blest;
Then take the wings of the morning,
And fly away to our rest.

From the sure word the prophets
have spoken,
There is light flashing forth
through the gloom;
For the Scripture can never be broken,
And the ing in His glory will come.

Now we sing 'mid the darkness
and shadows,
And we pray and we watch for the dawn;
Till the Day-star, in glory arising,
Shall betoken the coming of morn.

We are not of the night nor
of darkness,
Let us walk, then, as children of day;
Our weeping shall be for a moment,
And our joy shall ne'er vanish away!


174
Oh, the weary night is waning,

Oh, the weary night is waning,
And the clouds are rolling by;
See, the long-expected morning
Now is dawning in the sky;
When from Zion's lofty mountain
We shall hear the watchmen cry,
And rejoicing we shall gather
When the King shall come.

c
O Zion! O Zion! Great will be
thy triumph
When the King shall come;
O Zion! O Zion! Thou shalt be
exalted
When the King shall come.

When the ransomed of Jehovah,
From the East and from the West,
Shall return with joy and gladness,
To receive the promised rest—
Then shall every tribe and nation
Out of every land be blessed,
And rejoicing they shall gather
When the King shall come.

May He find us, when He cometh,
Faithful watchers, day and night,
At our royal post of duty,
With our armour shining bright;
May our lamps be trimmed and burning
With a clear and steady light,
That rejoicing we may gather
When the King shall come.


175
Behold, the Bridegroom cometh in

Behold, the Bridegroom cometh in
the middle of the night,
And blest is he whose loins are girt,
whose lamp is burning bright;
But woe to that dull servant whom
the Master shall surprise
With lamp untrimmed, unburning,
and with slumber in his eyes.

Do thou, my soul, keep watch, beware
lest thou in sleep sink down,
Lest thou be given o'er to death, and
lose the golden crown;
But see that thou art sober, with a
watchful eye, and thus
Cry, "Holy, Holy, Holy God, have
mercy upon us."

That day, the day of fear, shall come;
my soul, slack not thy toil,
But light thy lamp, and feed it well,
and make it bright with oil;
Thou knowest not how soon may
sound the cry at eventide:
"Behold the Bridegroom comes!
Arise, go forth to meet the Bride!"

Beware, my soul! take thou good
heed lest thou in slumber lie,
And, like the five, remain without,
and knock, and vainly cry;
But watch, and bear thy lamp undimmed,
and Christ shall gird thee on
His own bright wedding-robe of
light—the glory of the Son.


176
Our Lord is now rejected,

Our Lord is now rejected,
And by the world disowned;
By the many still neglected,
And by the few enthroned;
But soon He'll come in glory!
The hour is drawing nigh,
For the crowning day is coming
By and by.

c
Oh, the crowning day is coming!
Is coming by and by!
When our Lord shall come in" power"
And" glory" from on high!
Oh, the glorious sight will gladden
Each waiting, watchful eye,
In the crowning day that's coming
By and by.

The heavens shall glow
with splendour;
But brighter far than they,
The saints shall shine in glory,
As Christ shall them array:
The beauty of the Saviour
Shall dazzle every eye,
In the crowning day that's coming
By and by.

Our pain shall then be over:
We'll sin and sigh no more;
Behind us all of sorrow,
And nought but joy before—
A joy in our Redeemer,
As we to Him are nigh,
In the crowning day that's coming
By and by.

Let all that look for, hasten
The coming joyful day,
By earnest consecration,
To walk the narrow way;
By gathering in the lost ones.
For whom our Lord did die,
For the crowning day that's coming
By and by.


177
Jesus, Thy blood and righteousness

Jesus, Thy blood and righteousness
My beauty are, my glorious dress;
'Midst flaming worlds, in these
arrayed,
With joy shall I lift up my head.

When, from the dust of death, I rise
To take my mansion in the skies;
E'en then shall this be all my plea—
Jesus hath lived and died for me.

Bold shall I stand in that great day,
For who aught to my charge shall lay,
While, through Thy blood, absolved
I am
From sin's tremendous curse and
shame?

This spotless robe the same appears
When ruined nature sinks in years:
No age can change its glorious hue;
The robe of Christ is ever new.

Oh, let the dead now hear Thy voice!
Bid, Lord, Thy banished ones rejoice:
Their beauty this their glorious dress,
Jesus, Thy blood and righteousness.


178
Jesus is coming! sing the glad word!

Jesus is coming! sing the glad word!
Coming for those He redeemed by
His blood.
Coming to reign as the glorified Lord!
Jesus is coming again!

c
Jesus is coming, is coming again!
Jesus is coming again! . . .
Shout the glad tidings o'er
mountain and plain!
Jesus is coming again!

Jesus is coming! the dead shall arise,
Loved ones shall meet in a joyful
surprise,
Caught up together to Him in the skies.
Jesus is coming again!

Jesus is coming! His saints to release;
Coming to give to the warring
earth peace:
Sinning, and sighing, and sorrow
shall cease.
Jesus is coming again!

Jesus is coming! the promise is true
Who are the chosen, the faithful,
the few,
Waiting and watching, prepared
for review?
Jesus is coming again!


179
In the crimson blush of morning

In the crimson blush of morning
In the glitter of the noon,
In the midnight's gloomy darkness,
Or the gleaming of the moon.
In the stillness of the twilight,
As it shimmers in the sky,
We are watching, we are waiting,
For the end that draweth nigh.

We shall see our Lord in splendour,
And amid a countless throng,
On the clouds to earth descending,
With a movement swift and strong;
And the angels round about Him,
In their dazzling white array,
While before Him sounds the summons
For the final Judgment-day.

He will welcome all His people,
He will diadem His own;
He will show to them His glory,
And will share with them His throne;
And for ever in His presence
They shall see Him face to face,
While they chant His matchless wisdom,
And extol His wondrous grace.

He is coming, surely coming,
For His promise cannot fail;
And the scoffers shall behold Him?
And before Him they shall quail!
He is coming, quickly coming!
But His coming we shall greet;
We have waited for His advent,
And have listened for His feet.


180
Come on the wings of the morning;

Come on the wings of the morning;
Come, Thou Redeemer and King,
Hail to the day that is dawning,
Hail to the joy it will bring.
Oh, come on the wings of the morning!
Oh, come to our hearts as we sing! ...
Come as we sing in the day
that is dawning;
Oh, come, Thou Redeemer and King!

Come on the wings of the morning;
Come with Thy glory and grace,
All of Thy promise performing,
Showing the light of Thy face.

Come on the wings of the morning;
Come with a joyful surprise,
Lifting the sad and the mourning,
Wiping the tears from their eyes,

Come on the wings of the morning;
Come as the King to Thy throne;
Have we not sounded Thy warning?
Now let Thy glory be known.


181
Watch, earnestly watch, the Lord's

Watch, earnestly watch,
the Lord'sapproach is nearing;
Pray, fervently pray,
no man can know the hour;
Like as a thief at night is
His appearing;
He cometh to judge the world
in truth and power.

c
Watch ye, pray ye,
soldiers of the Lord;
Work ye, wait ye,
trusting in His word;
Keep His commandments?
and His law obey,
And He will reward you
in the last great day.

Work, joyfully work,
all ye who know His chastening;
Wait, patiently wait,
for your reward is nigh;
Lift up your heads,
the day of rest is hastening;
Rest, glorious rest,
with Jesus by and by.

Trust, loyally trust,
and as to Him thou'rt clinging,
Keep, faithfully keep the Saviour's
blest commands;
Then in thy heart the blest assurance
ringing,
Know surely thy name is written
in His hands.

The Lord is coming by-and-by:

The Lord is coming by-and-by:
Be ready when He comes!
He comes from His fair home on high:
Be ready when He comes!
He is the Lord our Righteousness,
And comes His chosen ones to bless,
And at His Father's throne confess:
Be ready when He comes!

c
Will you be ready when the Bridegroom
comes? . . .
Will you be ready when the Bridegroom
comes? . . .
will your lamps be trimmed and bright,
Be it morning, noon, or night?
Will you be ready when the Bridegroom
comes?

He soon will come to earth again:
Be ready when He comes!
Begin His universal reign:
Be ready when He comes!
With hallelujahs heaven will ring,
When Jesus doth redemption bring;
Oh, trim your lamps to meet your King!
Be ready when He comes!

Behold! He comes to one and all:
Be ready when He comes!
And soon we'll hear the trumpet call:
Be ready when He comes!
To Judgment called at His command,
From every clime, from every land,
Before His throne we all must stand:
Be ready when He comes!


183
Impatient heart, be still!

Impatient heart, be still!
What though He tarries long?
What though the triumph song
Is still delayed?
Thou hast His promise sure,
And that is all secure:
Be not afraid!
Be still! be still!
Impatient heart, be still!

My eager heart, be still!
Thy Lord will surely come,
And take thee to His home,
With Him to dwell:
It may not be to-day;
And yet, my soul, it may—
I cannot tell!
Be still! be still!
My eager heart, be still!

My anxious heart, be still!
Watch, work, and pray; and then
It will not matter when
Thy Lord shall come,
At midnight or at noon;
He cannot come too soon
To take thee home.
Be still! be still!
My anxious heart, be still!

A lamp in the night, a song in time

A LAMP in the night,
a song in time of sorrow,
A great glad hope which faith
can ever borrow
To gild the passing day with
the glory of the morrow,
Is the hope of the coming of the Lord.

c
Blessed hope, . . . blessed hope, . . .
Blessed hope of the coming of the Lord;
How the aching heart it cheers;
How it glistens through our tears,
Blessed hope of the coming of the Lord.

A star in the sky,
a beacon bright to guide us;
An anchor sure to hold when
storms betide us;
A refuge for the soul,
where in quiet we may hide us—
Is the hope of the coming of the Lord.

A call of command,
like trumpet clearly sounding,
To make us bold,
when evil is surrounding;
To stir the sluggish heart,
and to keep in good abounding—
Is the hope of the coming of the Lord.

A word from the One to all
our hearts the dearest,
A parting word to make
Him aye the nearest;
Of all His precious words,
the sweetest, brightest, clearest,
Is the hope of the coming of the Lord.


185
Well our lamps be filled and ready,

Well our lamps be filled and ready,
When the Bridegroom comes?
And our lights be clear and steady,
When the Bridegroom comes?
In the night, ... that solemn night,
Will our lamps be burning bright,
When the Bridegroom comes?

c
Oh, be ready! Oh, be ready!
Oh, be ready when the Bridegroom comes!

Shall we hear a welcome sounding,
When the Bridegroom comes?
And a shout of joy resounding,
When the Bridegroom comes?
In the night, that solemn night,
Will our lamps be burning bright,
When the Bridegroom comes!

Don't delay our preparation
Till the Bridegroom comes;
Lest there be a separation,
When the Bridegroom comes.
In the night, that solemn night,
Will our lamps be burning bright,
When the Bridegroom comes?

It may be a time of sorrow,
When the Bridegroom comes;
If our oil we hope to borrow,
When the Bridegroom comes.
In the night, that solemn night,
Will our lamps be burning bright,
When the Bridegroom comes?

Oh, there'll be a glorious meeting
When the Bridegroom comes!
And a hallelujah greeting,
When the Bridegroom comes!
In the night, that joyful night,
With our lamps all burning bright,
When the Bridegroom comes.

O watchman on the mountain height,

O watchman on the mountain height,
Proclaim the coming day;
Behold the spires of golden fires
Point upward far away.

c
Coming, yes, He's coming,
the Day-spring from on high;
Coming, yes, He's coming;
the promised hour is nigh;
Coming, yes, He's coming;
let all the ransomed sing;
The hills are bright with shining
light;
all hail the coming King!

O watchman, bid the sleeping Church
Awake, arise, and pray;
The heavenly Bridegroom soon will come,
And now is on His way.

All hail to Zion's glorious King,
By prophets long foretold;
Praise Him in song, ye angel throng,
Strike all your harps of gold.



187
Jesus, Thine all-victorious love

Jesus, Thine all-victorious love
Shed in my soul abroad;
Then shall my heart no longer rove,
Rooted and fixed in God.

Oh that in me the sacred fire
Might now begin to glow!
Burn up the dross of base desire,
And make the mountains flow.

Thou, who at Pentecost didst fall,
Do Thou my sins consume;
Come, Holy Ghost, for Thee I call;
Spirit of Burning, come!

Refining Fire, go through my heart,
Illuminate my soul;
Scatter Thy life through every part,
And sanctify the whole.

My steadfast soul, from falling free,
Shall then no longer move,
While Christ is all the world to me,
And all my heart is love.


188
Come, Holy Spirit, Heavenly Dove!

Come, Holy Spirit, Heavenly Dove!
With all Thy quickening powers,
Kindle a flame of sacred love
In these cold hearts of ours.

O Lord, and shall we ever live
At this poor dying rate?—
Our love so faint, so cold to Thee,
And Thine to us so great.

Come, Holy Spirit, Heavenly Dove!
With all Thy quickening powers,
Come, shed abroad a Saviour's love,
And that shall kindle ours.


189
Come, Holy Ghost, our hearts inspire;

Come, Holy Ghost, our hearts inspire;
Let us Thine influence prove,
Source of the old prophetic fire,
Fountain of light and love.

Come, Holy Ghost, for, moved by Thee,
The prophets wrote and spoke;
Unlock the truth, Thyself the Key,
Unseal the sacred book.

Expand Thy wings, celestial Dove,
Brood o'er our nature's night;
On our disordered spirits move,
And let there now be light.

God, through Himself,
we then shall know,
If Thou within us shine;
And sound, with all
Thy saints below,
The depths of love divine.


190
Come, Holy Spirit, come;

Come, Holy Spirit, come;
Let Thy bright beams arise,
Dispel the darkness from our minds,
And open all our eyes.

Revive our drooping faith,
Our doubts and fears remove,
And kindle in our breasts the flame
Of never-dying love.

Convince us of our sin,
Then lead to Jesus' blood,
And to our wondering view reveal
The secret love of God.

Tis Thine to cleanse the heart,
To sanctify the soul,
To pour fresh life in every part,
And new-create the whole.

Dwell therefore in our hearts,
Our minds from bondage free;
Then we shall know,
and praise, and love
The Father, Son, and Thee!


191
Our blest Redeemer, ere He breathed

Our blest Redeemer, ere He breathed
His tender, last farewell,
A Guide, a Comforter bequeathed
With us to dwell.

He came in semblance of a dove,
With sheltering wings outspread,
The holy balm of peace and love
On earth to shed.

He came in tongues of living flame,
To teach, convince, subdue;
All-powerful as the wind He came—
As viewless too.

He comes sweet influence to impart,
A gracious, willing Guest,
While He can find one humble heart
Wherein to rest.

And His that gentle voice we hear,
Soft as the breath of even,
That checks each fault,
that calms each fear,
And speaks of heaven.

And every virtue we possess,
And every victory won,
And every thought of holiness,
Are His alone.

Spirit of purity and grace,
Our weakness pitying see;
O make our hearts
Thy dwelling place,
And worthier Thee.


192
Holy Spirit, lead us now

Holy Spirit, lead us now
Boldly to the throne of grace;
While our heads in prayer we bow,
Let Thy presence fill this place:
Holy Spirit, Heavenly Guide,
Lead us to the Crucified!

This is now our time of need,
This is now the day of grace;
Now our souls with manna feed
Ere we leave this sacred place:
Holy Spirit, Heavenly Dove,
Lead us to the feast of love!

At the blessed mercy-seat
Peace and joy are freely given;
While we wait at Jesus' feet,
Make this place the gate of heaven:
Holy Spirit, Heavenly Friend,
Now upon our hearts descend!

Weak and sinful though we be,
Jesus' blood can cleanse from sin;
At the fountain full and free
Wash and make us pure within:
Holy Spirit, Cleansing fire,
Burn up every base desire!


193
Spirit Divine, Spirit Divine—

Spirit Divine, Spirit Divine—
Be Thou the Day-star on my
darkness to shine!

Spirit of Truth, Spirit of Truth-
Be Thou the Teacher and the Guide
of my youth!

Spirit of Love, Spirit of Love—
Be Thou the Leader to my mansion
above!

Spirit of Power, Spirit of Power—
Be Thou the praises of my song
evermore! Amen.


194
Holy Spirit, faithful Guide!

Holy Spirit, faithful Guide!
Ever near the Christian's side,
Gently lead us by the hand,
Pilgrims in a desert land;
Weary souls for aye rejoice,
While they hear that sweetest voice,
Whisp'ring softly, "Wanderer, come!
Follow me, I'll guide thee home!"

Ever present, truest Friend,
Ever near, Thine aid to lend,
Leave us not to doubt and fear,
Groping on in darkness drear:
When the storms are raging sore,
Hearts grow faint, and hopes give o'er,
Wtxkper softly, "Wanderer, come!
Follow Mc, I'll guide thee home!"

When our days of toil shall cease,
Waiting still for sweet release.
Noshing left but heaven and prayer,
Trusting that our names are there,
Wading deep the dismal flood,
Pleading naught but Jesus' blood;
Whisper softly, "Wanderer, come!
Follow Me, I'll guide thee home!"


195
Holy Spirit, like a dove descending,

Holy Spirit, like a dove descending,
Rest Thou upon us while we meet
to pray;
Show us the Saviour,
His great love revealing;
Lead us to Him, the Life,
the Truth, the Way.

Come, Holy Spirit,
every cloud dispelling;
Fill us with gladness,
through the Master's name:
String to our memory words
that He hath spoken,
Then shall our tongues
His wondrous grace proclaim.

Come, Holy Spirit,
sent from God the Father—
Thou Friend and Teacher,
Comforter and Guide—
Oar thoughts directing,
keep us close to Jesus,
And in our hearts for
evermore abide.


196
Come, Holy Ghost, in love,

Come, Holy Ghost, in love,
Shed on us from above
Thine own bright ray:
Divinely good Thou art;
Thy sacred gifts impart
To gladden each sad heart:
Oh, come to-day!

Come, tenderest Friend and best,
Our most delightful Guest,
With soothing power:
Rest, which the weary know;
Shade, 'mid the noontide glow;
Peace, when deep griefs o'erflow:
Cheer us this hour.

Come, Light serene and still,
Our inmost bosoms fill;
Dwell in each breast!
We know no dawn but Thine;
Send forth Thy beams divine.
On our dark souls to shine,
And make us blest.

Exalt our low desires,
Extinguish passion's fires,
Heal every wound;
Our stubborn spirits bend,
Our icy coldness end,
Our devious steps attend
While heavenward bound.

Come, all the faithful bless:
Let all who Christ confess
His praise employ;
Give virtue's rich reward;
Victorious death accord,
And, with our glorious Lord,
Eternal joy.


197
Hear us, Thou that broodedst o'er

Hear us, Thou that broodedst
o'er the watery deep,
Waking all creation
from its primal sleep:
Holy Spirit, breathing
breath of life divine,
Breathe into our spirits,
blending them with Thine.

c
Light and Life Immortal!
Hear us as we raise
Hearts, as well as voices,
Mingling prayer and praise.

When the sun ariseth
in a cloudless sky,
May we feel Thy presence,
Holy Spirit, nigh;
Shed Thy radiance o'er us,
keep it cloudless still,
Through the day before us,
perfecting Thy will.

When the fight is fiercest
in the noon tide heat,
Bear us, Holy Spirit,
to our Saviour's feet,
There to find a refuge
till our work is done,
There to fight the battle
till the battle's won.

If the day be falling
sadly as it goes,
Slowly in its sadness
sinking to its close,
May Thy love in mercy,
kindling ere it die,
Cast a ray of glory
o'er our evening sky.

Morning, noon, and evening,
when soe'er it be,
Grant us, gracious Spirit,
quickening life in Thee;
Life, that gives us, living,
life of heavenly love;
Life, that brings us, dying,
life from heaven above.


198
Oh, spread the tidings round,

Oh, spread the tidings round,
wherever man is found.
Wherever human hearts and
human woes abound;
Let every Christian tongue
proclaim the joyful sound:
The Comforter has come!

c
The Comforter has come,
the Comforter has come!
The Holy Ghost from heaven,
the Father's promise given;
Oh, spread the tidings round,
wherever man is found:
The Comforter has come!

The long, long night is past,
the morning breaks at last;
And hushed the dreadful wail and
fury of the blast,
As o'er the golden hills the day
advances fast:
The Comforter has come!

The mighty King of kings,
with healing in His wings,
To every captive soul a full
deliverance brings;
And through the vacant cells
the song of triumph rings:
The Comforter has come!

Oh, boundless love divine!
how shall this tongue of mine
To wondering mortals tell the
matchless grace divine—
That I may with Him dwell,
and in His image shine!—
The Comforter has come!

Oh, let the echoes fly above
the vaulted sky,
And all the saints above to
all below reply
In strains of endless love,
the song that ne'er will die:
The Comforter has come!


199
Holy Ghost, with light divine,

Holy Ghost, with light divine,
Shine upon this heart of mine;
Chase the shades of night away,
Turn my darkness into day.

Holy Ghost, with power divine,
Cleanse this guilty heart of mine;
Long hath sin, without control,
Held dominion o'er my soul.

Holy Ghost, with joy divine,
Cheer this saddened heart of mine
Bid my many woes depart,
Heal my wounded, bleeding heart.

Holy Spirit, all divine,
Dwell within this heart of mine;
Cast down every idol-throne,
Reign supreme—and reign alone!



200
Descend, O Flame of sacred fire:

Descend, O Flame of sacred fire:
Now may we feel Thy quickening power;
To purest love each heart inspire,
And keep us in each trying hour.

Come like a rushing wind, we pray,
And let Thy presence fill this place:
Oh, take our unbelief away,
Baptize us with Thy boundless grace.

Come down from heaven,
O quenchless Flame,
Through Christ, the Everlasting Son;
The riches of His love proclaim,
And melt our every heart in one.


201
Spirit Divine! attend our prayers.

Spirit Divine! attend our prayers.
And make our hearts Thy home;
Descend with all Thy gracious powers
Oh come, great Spirit, come!

Come as the light—to us reveal
Our emptiness and woe;
And lead us in those paths of life
Where all the righteous go.

Come as the fire—and purge our hearts,
Like sacrificial flame;
Let our whole soul an offering be
To our Redeemer's name.

Come as the dew—and sweetly bless
This consecrated hour;
May barrenness rejoice to own
Thy fertilising power.

Come as the dove—and spread Thy wings
The wings of peaceful love;
And let Thy church on earth become
Blest as the church above.

Come as the wind—with rushing sound
And Pentecostal grace;
That all of woman born may see
The glory of Thy face.


202
Come, Spirit, source of light,

Come, Spirit, source of light,
Thy grace is unconfined;
Dispel the gloomy shades of night,
The darkness of the mind.

Now to our eyes display
The truth Thy words reveal:
Cause us to run the heavenly way,
Delighting in Thy will.

Thy teachings make us know
The mysteries of Thy love;
The vanity of things below,
The joy of things above.

While through this maze we stray,
Oh, spread Thy beams abroad;
Disclose the dangers of the way,
And guide our steps to God.


203
All hail the power of Jesus' name!

All hail the power of Jesus' name!
Let angels prostrate fall;
Bring forth the royal diadem,
And crown Him Lord of all!

Crown Him, ye martyrs of our God,
Who from His altar call;
Extol the stem of Jesse's rod,
And crown Him Lord of all!

Ye chosen seed of Israel's race,
A remnant weak and small,
Hail Him who saves you by His grace,
And crown Him Lord of all!

Ye Gentile sinners, ne'er forget
The wormwood and the gall;
Go, spread your trophies at His feet,
And crown Him Lord of all!

Let every kindred, every tribe,
On this terrestrial ball,
To Him all majesty ascribe,
And crown Him Lord of all!

Oh that with yonder sacred throng
We at His feet may fall;
Join in the everlasting song,
And crown Him Lord of all!


204
Jesus, Thy name I love, All other names

Jesus, Thy name I love,
All other names above;
Jesus, my Lord!
Oh, Thou art all to me!
Nothing to please I see,
Nothing apart from Thee,
Jesus, my Lord!

Thou, blessed Son of God,
Hast bought me with Thy blood,
Jesus, my Lord!
Oh, how great is Thy love,
All other loves above,
Love that I daily prove,
Jesus, my Lord!

When unto Thee I flee,
Thou wilt my refuge be,
Jesus, my Lord!
What need I now to fear?
What earthly grief or care,
Since Thou art ever near?
Jesus, my Lord!

Soon Thou wilt come again!
I shall be happy then,
Jesus, my Lord!
Then Thine own face I'll see,
Then I shall like Thee be,
Then evermore with Thee,
Jesus, my Lord!


205
Oh, could I speak the matchless worth,

Oh, could I speak the matchless worth,
Oh, could I sound the glories forth
Which in my Saviour shine,
I'd soar, and touch the heavenly strings,
And vie with Gabriel, while he sings
In notes almost divine.

I'd sing the precious blood He spilt,
My ransom from the dreadful guilt
Of sin, and wrath divine:
I'd sing His glorious righteousness,
In which all -perfect, heavenly dress
My soul shall ever shine.

I'd sing the characters He bears,
And all the forms of love He wears,
Exalted on His throne:
In loftiest songs of sweetest praise
I would, to everlasting days,
Make all His glories known.

Well, the delightful day will come
When my dear Lord will take me home,
And I shall see His face;
Then with my Saviour, Brother,Friend,
A blest eternity I'll spend,
Triumphant in His grace!


206
We praise Thee, we bless Thee,our Saviour divine,

We praise Thee, we bless Thee,our Saviour divine,
All power and dominion for ever be Thine!
We sing of Thy mercy with joyful acclaim,
For Thou hast redeemed us: all praise to Thy name!

All honour and praise to Thine excellent name,
Thy love is unchanging—for ever the same!
We bless and adore Thee, O Saviour and King;
With joy and thanksgiving Thy praises we sing!

The strength of the hills and the depths of the sea,
The earth and its fulness, belong unto Thee;
And yet to the lowly Thou bendest
Thine ear, So ready their humble petitions to hear!

Thine infinite goodness our tongues shall employ;
Thou givest us richly all things to enjoy;
We'll follow Thy footsteps, we'll rest in Thy love,
And soon we shall praise Thee in mansions above!

Be joyful, for He is the Lord,
On earth and in heaven supreme;
He fashions and rules by His word;
The"Mighty" and"Strong" to redeem.

What though in the conflict for right
Your enemies almost prevail!
God's armies, just hid from your sight,
Are more than the foes which assail.

Though darkness surround you by day,
Your sky by the night be o'ercast,
Let nothing your spirit dismay,
But trust till the dagger is past.

Be glad in the Lord, and rejoice,
His praises proclaiming in song;
With harp, and with organ, and voice,
The loud hallelujahs prolong!

Power and glory unto the Lord belong;

For His promised presence all the pilgrim way,
For the flaming pillar, and the cloud by day.

Praise Him for the Fountain that can make us whole;
For His gifts of kindness and His loving care,
For the blest assurance that He answers prayer.

Binding us more closely to the things above;
For the faith that conquers, hope,
that naught can dim,
For the land where loved ones gather unto Him.

Gladly in His love confiding,
May our souls His praises sing.

What glories on the soul arise!

c
Redeemed! redeemed! ... my song shall be, ...
Through time and through ... eternity! ...
Redeemed! let all ... the ransomed sing, ...
Eternal praise ... to Christ our King!

Glory to Film, whose love unknown
Touched man's abyss from heaven's high throne;
Like some new star its radiance beamed,
A new song rose—Redeemed! redeemed!

As ocean's billows swell and break,
The mighty tide of praise shall wake;
Thy love, Lord, like th' unfathomed
sea, Shall waft a world redeemed to Thee.

Redeemed! creation joyful brings
Its tribute to the King of kings;
Redeemed! earth's million voices raise
One sounding anthem to His praise.

Of Jesus extol;

And rules over all.

God ruleth on high.
Almighty to save;
And st ill He is nigh,

The great congregation
His triumph shall sing.
Ascribing salvation
To Jesus our King.

Salvation to God,
Who sits on the throne;
Let all ciy aloud,
And honour the Son;
The praises of Jesus
All angels proclaim,
Fall down on their faces,
And worship the Lamb.

Then let us adore
And give Him his right;
All glory and power,
All wisdom and might;
All honour and blessing,
With angels above;
And thanks never-ceasing,
And infinite love.

How honoured, how dear, that sacred abode,

How honoured, how dear, that sacred abode,
Where Christians draw near their Father and God!
'Mid worldly commotion, my wearied soul faints
For the house of devotion, the home of Thy saints.

The birds have their home, they fix on their nest;
Wherever they roam, they turn to their rest:
From them fondly learning, my soul would take wing;
To Thee so returning, my God and my King.

O happy the choirs who praise Thee above!
What joy tunes their lyres! their worship is love.
Yet safe in Thy keeping and happy they be
In this world of weeping, whose strength is in Thee.

Though rugged their way, they drink,as they go,
Of springs that convey new life as they flow:
The God they rely on, their strength shall renew,
Till each, brought to Zion, His glory shall view.

Thou Hearer of prayer, still grant me a place
Where Christians repair to the courts of Thy grace:
More blest, beyond measure, one day so employed,
Than years of vain pleasure by worldlings enjoyed.

The Lord is a Sun, the Lord is a Shield;
What grace has begun, with glory is sealed.
He hears the distressed, He succours the just:
And they shall be blessed who make Him their trust.


214
Coming, coming, we are coming

Coming, coming, we are coming
To Thy temple, gracious Lord,
To receive the blessed teaching
Of Thy pure and perfect Word;
Meekly would we learn our duty,
Learn it kneeling at Thy feet,
While a radiance from Thy glory
Covers all the Mercy-seat.

Singing, singing, we are singing
Of Thy wondrous love so free,
How it floweth ever onward
Like a vast and mighty sea;
And our souls mount up with gladness,
While we swell the lofty strain,
"Glory, glory, hallelujah
To the Lamb for sinners slain!"

Praying, praying, we are praying
That Thy Spirit, like a dove,
May descend with gifts of mercy
From Thy gracious hand above.
Lord, we ask that, by Thy watch-care,
We may all protected be.
Every hand be quick to labour,
And our hearts be stayed on Thee.

Praise ye the Lord! joyfully shout hosanna!

Praise ye the Lord! joyfully shout hosanna!
Praise the Lord with glad acclaim;
Lift up your hearts unto His throne with gladness—
Magnify His holy name.
Marching along under His banner bright,
Trusting in His mercy as we go.
His light divine tenderly o'er us will shine;
We shall be guided by His hand now and for ever.

Steadily marching on, with our banner waving o'er us;
Steadily marching on, while we sing the joyful chorus;
Steadily marching on, pillar and cloud going before us,
To the realms of glory, to our home on high.

Praise ye the Lord! He is the King eternal;
Glory be to God on high!
Praise ye the Lord, tell of His loving kindness—
Join the chorus of the sky.
Still marching on, cheerily marching on,
In the ranks of Jesus we will go:
Home to our rest, joyfully home where the blest
Gather and praise the Saviour's
name, praise Him for ever.

I heard the voice of Jesus say,

I heard the voice of Jesus say,
"Come unto Me, and rest:
Lay down, thou weary one, lay down
Thy head upon My breast."
I came to Jesus as I was—
Weary, and worn, and sad;
I found in Him a resting-place,
And He has made me glad.

I heard the voice of Jesus say,
"Behold, I freely give
The living water—thirsty one,
Stoop down, and drink, and live"
I came to Jesus, and I drank
Of that life-giving stream;
My thirst was quenched, my soul revived
And now I live in Him.

I heard the voice of Jesus say,
"lam this dark world's Light;
Look unto Me, thy morn shall rise,
And all thy day be bright."
I looked to Jesus, and I found
In Him my Star, my Sun;
And in that light of life I'll walk,
Till travelling days are done.


217
Jerusalem the golden! With milk and honey blest;

Jerusalem the golden!
With milk and honey blest;
Beneath thy contemplation
Sink heart and voice opprest.
I know not, oh, I know not
What holy joys are there;
What radiancy of glory,
What bliss beyond compare.

They stand, those halls of Zion,
All jubilant with song,
And bright with many an angel,
And all the martyr-throng.
There is the throne of David;
And there, from toil released,
The shout of them that triumph,
The song of them that feast.

And they who, with their Leader,
Have conquered in the fight,
For ever and for ever
Are clad in robes of white.
O land that see'st no sorrow!
O state that fear'st no strife!
O royal land of flowers!
O realm and home of life!

O sweet and bless6d country!
The home of God's elect:
O sweet and blessed country
That eager hearts expect!
Jesus, in mercy bring us
To that dear land of rest;
Who art, with God the Father,
And Spirit, ever blest!


218
I feel like singing all the time,

I feel like singing all the time,
My tears are wiped away;
For Jesus is a Friend of mine,
I'll serve Him every day.

c
I'll praise Him! praise Him!
praise Him all the time!
Praise Him! praise Him!
I'll praise Him all the time!

When on the cross my Lord I saw,
Nailed there by sins of mine,
Fast fell the burning tears; but now
I'm singing all the time.

When fierce temptations try my heart,
I'll sing, "Jesus is mine!"
And so, though tears at times may start,
I'm singing all the time.

The wondrous story of the Lamb
Tell with that voice of thine,
Till others, with the glad new song,
Go singing all the time.


219
Praise our Creator and Saviour eternal!

Praise our Creator and Saviour eternal!
Him who redeemed us from death and the grave;
Sing of His greatness, oh, hail and adore Him,
Strong to deliver and mighty to save.

c
Praise ... Him! ... praise ... Him! ...
Glory in the highest unto Him ascribing;
Praise ... Him! ... praise ... Him! ...
Blessed be His name, our Lord and King!

Praise our Creator and gracious Defender!
Rock where in safety we still may abide;
He is our Shepherd, how gently He leads us
Where in the valley the cool waters glide!

Praise our Creator, the Fountain of goodness!
Now in His grandeur exalted above;
Rest in His mercy and trust in His promise,
Ever to keep us, upheld by His love.


220
Praise the Lord and worship Him,a song prepare,

Praise the Lord and worship Him, a song prepare,
While we enter joyfully the house of prayer;
Praise the Lord and honour Him who guards our way,
Watching o'er us tenderly by night and day.

c
Praise Him! praise Him! join the loud acclaim;
Praise Him! praise Him! bless His holy name;
Ever kind and merciful in all His ways,
He alone is worthy to receive our praise.

Praise Him in His majesty and strength arrayed;
Praise Him in the firmament His hands have made;
In our lives acknowledge Him the King of kings,
Then in safety we may dwell beneath His wings,

Praise Him in His righteousness, the Holy One;
Spread abroad the wondrous work that He hath done;
Through His perfect sacrifice the world is blest,
Whosoever will, may come to Him and rest.


221
Glorious things of thee are spoken,

Glorious things of thee are spoken,
Zion, city of our God!
He, whose word cannot be broken,
Formed thee for His own abode.
On the Rock of Ages founded,
What can shake thy sure repose?
With salvation's walls surrounded,
Thou may'st smile at all thy foes.

See, the streams of living waters,
Springing from eternal love,
Well supply thy sons and daughters,
And all fear of want remove:
Who can faint, while such a river
Ever flows their thirst t' assuage?—
Grace, which, like the Lord, the giver,
Never fails from age to age.

Round each habitation hovering,
See the cloud and fire appear!
For a glory and a covering,
Showing that the Lord is near;
He who gives them daily manna,
He who listens when they cry—
Let Him hear the loud hosanna,
Rising to His throne on high.


222
Awake, awake, O heart of mine!

Awake, awake, O heart of mine!
Sing praise to God above;
Take up the song of endless years,
And sing redeeming love!
Redeemed by Him who bore my sins,
When on the cross He died;
Redeemed and purchased with His blood,
Redeemed and sanctified,

c
Awake, awake, ... O heart of mine! ...
Sing praise, sing praise ... to God above; ...
Take up the song ... of endless years, ...
And sing ... redeeming love! ...

Redeemed by Him, my Lord and King,
Who saves me day by day;
My life and all its ransomed powers
Could ne'er His love repay.
And yet His mercy condescends
My humble gift to own;
And through the riches of His grace,
He brings me near His throne.

Oh, love unchanging, love sublime!
Not all the hosts above
Can reach the height or sound the depth
Of God's eternal love.
This wondrous love enfolds the world,
It fills the realms above;
Tis boundless as eternity:
Oh, praise the God of love!


223
Holy, holy, holy is the Lord!

Holy, holy, holy is the Lord!
Sing, O ye people, gladly adore Him;
Let the mountains tremble at His word,
Let the hills be joyful before Him;
Mighty in wisdom, boundless in mercy,
Great is Jehovah, King over all!

c
Holy, holy, holy is the Lord,
Let the hills be joyful before Him!

Praise Him, praise Him, shout aloud for joy!
Watchman of Zion, herald the story;
Sin and death His kingdom shall destroy,
All the earth shall sing of His glory;
Praise Him, ye angels, ye who behold Him
Robed in His splendour, matchless,divine!

King eternal, blessed be His name!
So may His children gladly adore Him;
When in heaven we join the happy strain,
When we cast our bright crowns before Him;
There in His likeness joyful awaking,
There we shall see Him, there we shall sing!


224
Rejoice and be glad! the Redeemer has come!

Rejoice and be glad! the Redeemer has come!
Go look on His cradle, His cross, and His tomb.

c
Sound His praises! tell the story of Him who was slain!
Sound His praises! tell with gladness, He liveth again!

Rejoice and be glad! it is sunshine at last!
The clouds have departed, the shadows are past.

Rejoice and be glad! for the blood hath been shed;
Redemption is finished, the price hath been paid.

Rejoice and be glad! now the pardon is free!
The Just for the unjust has died on the tree.

Rejoice and be glad! for the Lamb that was slain
O'er death is triumphant, and liveth again.

Rejoice and be glad! for our King is on high;
He pleadeth for us on His throne in the sky.

Rejoice and be glad! for He cometh again;
He cometh in glory, the Lamb that was slain.

c
Sound His praises! tell the story of Him
who was slain!
Sound His praises! tell with gladness,
He cometh again!


225
Oh, sing of my Redeemer, My Saviour, Lord, and King;

Oh, sing of my Redeemer,
My Saviour, Lord, and King;
A song of praise and glory
Let all with rapture sing.

c
Oh, sing ... of my Redeemer, . . .
Who gave . . . Himself for me;
Upon . . . the cross He suffered, .
From sin ... to set me free. . .

Oh, sing of my Redeemer,
And spread abroad His name;
His mercy, free and boundless,
Let heaven and earth proclaim.

Oh, sing of my Redeemer!
His praise my theme shall be;
He took my sins upon Him,
And bore them on the tree.

Oh, sing of my Redeemer!
On Him alone I call;
My everlasting portion,
My Hope, my Life, my All.


226
O Saviour, precious Saviour,Whom, yet unseen, we love;

O Saviour, precious Saviour,
Whom, yet unseen, we love;
O Name of might and favour,
All other names above:

c
We worship Thee! we bless Thee!
To Thee alone we sing!
We praise Thee and confess Thee,
Our Saviour, Lord, and King!

O bringer of salvation,
Who wondrously hast wrought
Thyself the revelation
Of love beyond our thought:

In Thee all fulness dwelleth,
All grace and power divine;
The glory that excelleth,
O Son of God, is Thine!

Oh, grant the consummation
Of this our song, above,
In endless adoration.
And everlasting love.


227
Jesus, Lover of my soul,Let me to Thy bosom fly,

Jesus, Lover of my soul,
Let me to Thy bosom fly,
While the nearer waters roll,
While the tempest still is high;
Hide me, O my Saviour, hide,
Till the storm of life is past;
Safe into the haven guide.
Oh, receive my soul at last!

Other refuge have I none,
Hangs my helpless soul on Thee;
Leave, oh, leave me not alone,
Still support and comfort me:
All my trust on Thee is stayed,
All my help from Thee I bring;
Cover my defenceless head
With the shadow of Thy wing.

Thou, O Christ, art all I want;
More than all in Thee I find:
Raise the fallen, cheer the faint,
Heal the sick, and lead the blind:
Just and holy is Thy name,
I am all unrighteousness;
Vile, and full of sin I am,
Thou art full of truth and grace.

Plenteous grace with Thee is found—
Grace to cover all my sin:
Let the healing streams abound;
Make me, keep me pure within:
Thou of life the Fountain art,
Freely let me take of Thee:
Spring Thou up within my heart,
Rise to all eternity.


228
The church's one foundation Is Jesus Christ her Lord;

The church's one foundation
Is Jesus Christ her Lord;
She is His new creation
By water and the Word:
From Heaven He came and sought her
To be His holy bride;
With His own blood He bought her,
And for her life He died.

Elect from every nation,
Yet one o'er all the earth;
Her charter of salvation—
One Lord, one faith, one birth;
One holy Name she blesses,
Partakes one holy food;
And to one hope she presses,
With every grace endued.

Though with a scornful wonder
Men see her sore opprest,
By schisms rent asunder,
By heresies distrest:
Yet saints their watch are keeping,
Their cry goes up, "How long?
"And soon the night of weeping
Shall be the morn of song.

'Mid toil and tribulation,
And tumults of her war,
She waits the consummation
Of peace for evermore;
Till with the vision glorious
Her longing eyes are blest,
And the great church victorious,
Shall be the church at rest.

Yet she on earth hath union
With God the Three in One,
And mystic sweet communion
With those whose rest is won:
Oh, happy ones and holy!
Lord, give us grace, that we,
Like them, the meek and lowly,
On high may dwell with Thee!


229
Great is the Lord, who ruleth over all:

Great is the Lord, who ruleth over all:
Wake, wake, and sing! wake, wake, and sing!
Down at His feet in adoration fall-
Praise and magnify our King!

c
O ye redeemed above, strike,strike
your harps of love!
Hail the Blessed One! hail the Mighty One!
Sweetly His wonders tell, loudly His glory swell—
Praise and magnify our King!

Great is the Lord, who spake and it was done:
Honour and strength, dominion He has won.

Great is the Lord! oh, come with holy mirth;
Come and rejoice, ye nations of the earth.

Great is the Lord, and holy is His name!
Angels and men, His wondrous works proclaim.


230
Come, every joyful heart, That loves the Saviour's name,

Come, every joyful heart,
That loves the Saviour's name,
Your noblest powers exert
To celebrate His fame;
Tell all above and all below,
The debt of love to Him you owe.

He left His starry crown,
And laid His robes aside;
On wings of love came down.
And wept, and bled, and died:
What he endured no tongue can tell,
To save our souls from death and hell.

From the dark grave He rose—
The mansion of the dead;
And thence His mighty foes
In glorious triumph led:
Up through the sky the Conqueror rode,
And reigns on high, the Saviour God-

From thence He'll quickly come—
His chariot will not stay—
And bear our spirits home
To realms of endless day:
There shall we see His lovely face,
And ever be in His embrace.


231
Hark, hark! my soul! angelic songs are swelling

Hark, hark! my soul! angelic songs are swelling
O'er earth's green fields and ocean s wave-beat shore;
How sweet the truth those blessed strains are telling
Of that new life when sin shall be no more.
Angels, sing on! your faithful watches keeping;
Sing us sweet fragments of the songs above;
Till morning's joy shall end the night of weeping,
And life's long shadows break in cloudless love.

Far, far away, like bells at evening pealing,
The voice of Jesus sounds o'er land and sea
And laden souls, by thousands meekly stealing,
Kind Shepherd, turn their weary steps to Thee.

Onward we go, for still we hear them singing,
"Come, weary souls! for Jesus bids you come";
And through the dark, its echoes sweetly ringing,
The music of the Gospel leads us home.


232
Wake Thou my harp, O Mighty Love,

Wake Thou my harp, O Mighty Love,
That fiirst the boundless realm above!
Sweep Thou my strings, for I would sing
Redeeming grace through Christ my King.

c
Redeeming grace, redeeming grace,
That gives my soul a resting-place;
I'll sing, while time rolls on apace,
Redeeming grace, redeeming grace.

Thou great First Cause of mortal good,
Whose throne through endless years has stood,
Instruct my feeble voice to sing
Redeeming grace through Christ my King.

The spark has kindled to a flame;
My soul, rejoicing in Thy name.
Bids all within me join and sing
Redeeming grace through Christ my King.

And when my spirit flees away
From all that cheers life's fleeting day.
With saints around Thy throne I'll sing
Redeeming grace through Christ my King


233
"God is Love!"—His Word proclaims it,

"God is Love!"—His Word proclaims it,
Day by day the truth we prove;
Heaven and earth with joy are telling.
Ever telling, "God is Love!

c
Hallelujah! tell the story,
Sung by angel choirs above;
Sounding forth the mighty chorus—
"God is Light, and God is Love!"

"God is Love!"—oh, tell it gladly,
How the Saviour from above
Came to seek and save the lost ones.
Showing thus the Father's love.

"God is Love!"—oh, boundless mercy—
May we all its fulness prove!
Telling those who sit in darkness,
"God is Light, and God is Love!


234
Let us sing again the praise of the Saviour,

Let us sing again the praise of the Saviour,
How He died that we might know the Father's love;
Let us tell to all the world His compassion,
How He ever lives to plead for us above.

c
Let us tell ... the wondrous story,
How He died . . . upon the tree;
Unto Him be all the praise and the glory;
He hath suffered that from sin we might be free...

Let us praise Him for the words full of comfort,
That He left for us recorded long ago;
He is near to every one that believeth,
And His mercy to the faithful He will show.

Let us praise Him for the soul-cheering promise
Of the mansions that our eyes shall yet behold;
When we gather with the blest in His kingdom,
Where the riches of His grace can ne'er be told.


235
My faith looks up to Thee, Thou Lamb of Calvary,

My faith looks up to Thee,
Thou Lamb of Calvary,
Saviour divine;
Now hear me while I pray;
Take all my guilt away;
Oh, let me from this day
Be wholly Thine.

May Thy rich grace impart
Strength to my fainting heart,
My zeal inspire:
As Thou hast died for me,
Oh, may my love to Thee
Pure, warm, and changeless be—
A living fire.

While life's dark maze I tread,
And griefs around me spread,
Be Thou my Guide:
Bid darkness turn to day,
Wipe sorrow's tears away;
Nor let me ever stray
From Thee aside.

When ends life's transient dream—
When death's cold, sullen stream
Shall o'er me roll—
Blest Saviour, then in love,
Fear and distrust remove;
Oh, bear me safe above—
A ransomed soul.


236
Come, oh come, and let us worship,

Come, oh come, and let us worship,
Gathered in the house of prayer;
Praise the God of our salvation
While He waits to meet us there.

c
Come, oh come, and let us worship.
Bringing songs of love and praise,
Unto Him whose loving kindness
Has been o'er us all our days.

He hath pardoned our transgressions
Taken all our sins away;
He will lead us, by His Spirit,
Safely to the perfect day.

Soon our trials will be ended,
And, among the loved and blest,
We shall join the bright immortals
In that Home of joy and rest.


237
Rock of Ages, cleft for me,

Rock of Ages, cleft for me,
Let me hide myself in Thee;
Let the water and the blood,
From Thy riven side which flowed,
Be of sin the double cure,
Save me from its guilt and power.

Not the labour of my hands
Can fulfil Thy law's demands;
Could my zeal no respite know,
Could my tears for ever flow,
All for sin could not atone;
Thou must save, and Thou alone.

Nothing in my hand I bring;
Simply to Thy Cross I cling!
Naked, come to Thee for dress;
Helpless, look to Thee for grace:
Foul, I to the fountain fly;
Wash me, Saviour, or I die.

While I draw this fleeting breath,
When mine eyes shall close in death,
When I soar to worlds unknown,
See Thee on Thy Judgment-throne;
Rock of Ages, cleft for me,
Let me hide myself in Thee.


238
God of love, and God of might,

God of love, and God of might,
God of truth, and God of light,
Heart and voice we would unite,
Giving praise to Thee.

With the sweets of morning's balm,
With the hush of evening's calm,
Fervent hymn and holy psalm
Rise continually.

We adore Thee, God most high,
We Thy mercy magnify;
On Thy word our souls rely,
Trusting peacefully.

We have heard Thy words of cheer
On our pilgrim journey here;
We have known Thy presence near,
Shining constantly.


239
In the cross of Christ I glory,

In the cross of Christ I glory,
Towering o'er the wrecks of time;
All the light of sacred story
Gathers round its head sublime.

When the woes of life o'ertake me,
Hopes deceive, and fears annoy,
Never shall the cross forsake me;
Lo! it glows with peace and joy.

When the sun of bliss is beaming
Light and love upon my way,
From the cross the radiance streaming
Adds new lustre to the day.

Bane and blessing, pain and pleasure,
By the cross are sanctified;
Peace is there that knows no measure,
Joys that through all time abide.


240
I've learned to sing a glad new song

I've learned to sing a glad new song
Of praise unto our King!
And now with all my ransomed powers
His praises I will sing.

c
His praises I will sing!
He is my Lord and King!
And now with all my ransomed powers
His praises I will sing!

I've learned to sing the song of peace,
Tis sweeter every day,
Since Jesus calmed my troubled soul,
And bore my sins away.

I sing the song of perfect love,
It casteth out all fear!
Oh breadth, oh length, oh depth,
oh height! Oh love so full of cheer!

I've learned to sing the song of joy;
My cup is running o'er
With blessings full of peace and love:
And still there's more and more.

Soon I shall sing the new, new song
Of Moses and the Lamb,
With all the sainted hosts above,
Before the great I AM!


241
My Saviour's praises I will sing,

My Saviour's praises I will sing,
And all His love express;
Whose mercies each returning day,
Proclaim His faithfulness.

c
"Every day will I bless Thee!
Every day will I bless Thee!
And I will praise, will praise
Thy name for ever and ever!"

Redeemed by His almighty power,
My Saviour and my King;
My confidence in Him I place,
To Him my soul would cling.

On Thee alone, my Saviour, God,
My steadfast hopes depend;
And to Thy holy will my soul
Submissively would bend.

Oh, grant Thy Holy Spirit's grace,
And aid my feeble powers,
That gladly I may follow Thee
Through all my future hours.


242
Love divine, all loves excelling,

Love divine, all loves excelling,
Joy of heaven, to earth come down;
Fix in us Thy humble dwelling,
All Thy faithful mercies crown.
Jesus, Thou art all compassion,
Pure unbounded love Thou art;
Visit us with Thy salvation,
Enter every longing heart!

Breathe, oh, breathe Thy loving Spirit
Into every troubled breast!
Let us all in Thee inherit,
Let us find Thy promised rest.
Come, Almighty to deliver!
Let us all Thy grace receive;
Suddenly return, and never,
Never more Thy temples leave.

Finish, then, Thy new creation,
Pure and spotless may we be;
Let us see our whole salvation
Perfectly secured by Thee:
Changed from glory into glory,
Till in heaven we take our place;
Till we cast our crowns before Thee,
Lost in wonder, love, and praise!


243
Oh for a thousand tongues to sing

Oh for a thousand tongues to sing
My great Redeemer's praise;
The glories of my God and King,
The triumphs of His grace.

My gracious Master and my God,
Assist me to proclaim—
To spread thro' all the earth abroad—
The honours of Thy name.

Jesus, the Name that charms our fears,
That bids our sorrows cease;
'Tis music in the sinner's ears,
'Tis life, and health, and peace.

He breaks the power of cancelled sin,
He sets the prisoner free;
His blood can make the foulest clean,
His blood avails for me.


244
I to the hills will lift mine eyes,

I to the hills will lift mine eyes,
From whence doth come mine aid;
My safety cometh from the Lord,
Who heaven and earth hath made.

Thy foot He'll not let slide, nor will
He slumber that thee keeps:
Behold, He that keeps Israel,
He slumbers not nor sleeps.

The Lord thee keeps, the Lord thy shade
On thy right hand doth stay:
The moon by night thee shall not smite,
Nor yet the sun by day.


The Lord shall keep thy soul; He shall
Preserve thee from all ill:
Henceforth thy going out and in
God keep for ever will.


245
Come, let us join our cheerful songs

Come, let us join our cheerful songs
With angels round the throne;
Ten thousand thousand are their tongues,
But all their joys are one.

"Worthy the Lamb that died, "they cry,
"To be exalted thus";
"Worthy the Lamb, "our lips reply,
"For He was slain for us."

Jesus is worthy to receive
Honour and power divine;
And blessings more than we can give,
Be, Lord, for ever Thine.

Let all that dwell above the sky,
And air, and earth, and seas,
Conspire to lift Thy glories high,
And speak Thine endless praise.

The whole creation join in one,
To bless the sacred name
Of Him that sits upon the throne,
And to adore the Lamb.


246
My God, I thank Thee, who hast made,

My God, I thank Thee, who hast made,
The earth so bright,
So full of splendour and of joy,
Beauty and light;
So many glorious things are here,
Noble and right.

I thank Thee, too, that Thou hast made
Joy to abound;
So many gentle thoughts and deeds
Circling us round;
That in the darkest spot of earth
Some love is found.

I thank Thee more that all my joy
Is touched with pain;
That shadows fall on brightest hours,
That thorns remain;
So that earth's bliss may be my guide,
And not my chain.

For Thou who knowest, Lord, how soon
Our weak heart clings,
Hast given us joys, tender and true,
Yet all with wings,
So that we see, gleaming on high,
Diviner things.

I thank Thee, Lord, that Thou hast kept
The best in store;
I have enough, yet not too much,
To long for more;
A yearning for a deeper peace
Not known before.

I thank Thee, Lord, that here our souls,
Though amply blest,
Can never find, although they seek,
A perfect rest—
Nor ever shall, until they lean
On Jesus' breast.


247
"Oh, serve the Lord with gladness,"

"Oh, serve the Lord with gladness,"
And come before His throne;
He is the great Creator,
And He is God alone;
The heavens declare His glory,
The earth His power displays;
While millions without number
To Him glad anthems raise.

c
"Oh, serve the Lord with gladness,"
And come before His throne!
He is our great Redeemer,
And He is God alone.

"Oh, serve the Lord with gladness,"
And glad hosannas bring
To Him, the Sovereign Ruler,
The universal King;
For ever through the ages
His truth unchanging stands;
Let all the nations fear Him,
And reverence His commands.

"Oh, serve the Lord with gladness,"
His love to all proclaim;
Exalt Him in the highest,
And spread abroad His fame;
All majesty, dominion,
All power and glory, be
To Him who reigns in triumph,
Through all eternity.


248
Songs of praise the angels sang,

Songs of praise the angels sang,
Heaven with hallelujahs rang,
When Jehovah's work begun,
When He spake, and it was done.

Songs of praise awoke the morn,
When the Prince of Peace was born;
Songs of praise arose, when He
Captive led captivity.

Heaven and earth must pass away,
Songs of praise shall crown that day;
God will make new heavens and earth,
Songs of praise shall hail their birth.

And will man alone be dumb,
Till that glorious Kingdom come?
No: —the Church delights to raise
Psalms, and hymns, and songs of praise.

Saints below, with heart and voice,
Still in songs of praise rejoice;
Learning here, by faith and love,
Songs of praise to sing above.

Borne upon their latest breath,
Songs of praise shall conquer death;
Then, amidst eternal joy,
Songs of praise their powers employ.


249
Come, sound His praise abroad,

Come, sound His praise abroad,
And hymns of glory sing!
Jehovah is the sovereign God,
The universal King!

He formed the deeps unknown;
He gave the seas their bound:
The watery worlds are all His own,
And all the solid ground.

Come, worship at His throne,
Come, bow before the Lord:
We are His work, and not our own,
He formed us by His word.

To-day attend His voice,
Nor dare provoke His rod;
Come, like the people of His choice,
And own your gracious God.


250
My life flows on in endless song

My life flows on in endless song;
Above earth's lamentation
I hear the sweet though far-off hymn
That hails a new creation:
Through all the tumult and the strife
I hear the music ringing;
It finds an echo in my soul-
How can I keep from singing?

What though my joys and comforts die!
The Lord my Saviour liveth;
What though the darkness gather round!
Songs in the night He giveth:
No storm can shake my inmost calm
While to that refuge clinging;
Since Christ is Lord of heaven and earth,
How can I keep from singing?

I lift mine eyes; the cloud grows thin;
I see the blue above it;
And day by day this pathway smooths
Since first I learned to love it:
The peace of Christ makes fresh my heart,
A fountain ever springing:
All things are mine since I am His—
How can I keep from singing?


251
Awake, my soul, in joyful lays,

Awake, my soul, in joyful lays,
And sing thy great Redeemer's praise;
He justly claims a song from me:
His loving-kindness, oh, how free!

He saw me ruined by the Fall,
Yet loved me, notwithstanding all;
He saved me from my lost estate:
His loving-kindness, oh, how great!

Though numerous hosts of mighty foes,
Though earth and hell my way oppose,
He safely leads my soul along:
His loving-kindness, oh, how strong!


252
Before Jehovah's awful throne,

Before Jehovah's awful throne,
Ye nations, bow with sacred joy:
Know that the Lord is God alone,
He can create, and He destroy.

His sovereign power, without our aid,
Made us of clay, and formed us men;
And when like wandering sheep we strayed,
He brought us to His fold again.

We'll crowd Thy gates with thankful songs,
High as the heavens our voices raise;
And earth, with her ten thousand tongues,
Shall fill Thy courts with sounding praise.

Wide as the world is Thy command,
Vast as eternity Thy love;
Firm as a rock Thy truth must stand,
When rolling years shall cease to move.


253
I love Thy kingdom, Lord, The house of Thine abode,

I love Thy kingdom, Lord,
The house of Thine abode,
The Church our blest Redeemer saved
With His own precious blood.

I love Thy Church, O God!
Her walls before Thee stand,
Dear as the apple of Thine eye,
And graven on Thy hand.

For her my tears shall fall,
For her my prayers ascend;
To her my cares and toils be given,
Till toils and cares shall end.

Beyond my highest joy
I prize her heavenly ways,
Her sweet communion, solemn vows,
Her hymns of love and praise.

Sure as Thy truth shall last,
To Zion shall be given
The brightest glories earth can yield,
And brighter bliss of heaven.


254
Awake, and sing the song Of Moses and the Lamb;

Awake, and sing the song
Of Moses and the Lamb;
Wake every heart and every tongue
To praise the Saviour's name.

Sing of His dying love;
Sing of His risen power;
Sing how He intercedes above
For those whose sins He bore.

Ye pilgrims on the road
To Zion's city, sing!
Rejoice ye in the Lamb of God—
In Christ, th' eternal King!

There shall each raptured tongue
His endless praise proclaim;
And sweeter voices tune the song
Of Moses and the Lamb.


255
In Thy name, O Lord, assembling,

In Thy name, O Lord, assembling,
We Thy people now draw near;
Teach us to rejoice with trembling,
Speak, and let Thy servants hear,
Hear with meekness,
Hear Thy Word with godly fear.

While our days on earth are lengthened,
May we give them, Lord, to Thee;
Cheered by hope, and daily strengthened,
May we run, nor weary be;
Till Thy glory,
Without clouds in heaven we see.

Then in worship purer, sweeter,
Thee Thy people shall adore,
Tasting of enjoyment greater
Far than thought conceived before;
Full enjoyment,
Full, unmixed, and evermore.


256
Glory be to the Father, and to the Son,

Glory be to the Father, and to the
Son, and to the Holy Ghost;
As it was in the beginning, is now,
and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.


257
Oh, tell me the story that never grows old,

Oh, tell me the story that never grows old,
The story of One whom the prophets foretold;
The Horn of salvation, the Sceptre, the Star,
The Light in the darkness they saw from afar.

c
It never grows old, it never grows old;
The story of Jesus will never grow old.

Oh, tell me the story that never grows old,
The story the angel at Bethlehem told;
The Babe in the manger, of lowliest birth,
The highest archangel excelling in worth.

Oh, tell me the story that never grows old,
The story the Gospels repeat manifold;
The love and compassion in Jesus we trace,
The power and patience, the glory and grace.

Oh, tell me the story that never grows old,
The story the ages to come will unfold;
The kindness of God in redeeming the lost;
The death of our Saviour in paying the cost.


258
Father of mercies! in Thy Word

Father of mercies! in Thy Word
What endless glory shines!
For ever be Thy name adored
For these celestial lines.

Here may the wretched sons of want
Exhaustless riches find;
Riches above what earth can grant,
And lasting as the mind.

Here the Redeemer's welcome voice
Spreads heavenly peace around;
And life and everlasting joys
Attend the blissful sound.

Oh, may these heavenly pages be
My ever dear delight!
And still new beauties may I see,
And still increasing light.

Divine Instructor, gracious Lord!
Be Thou for ever near;
Teach me to love Thy sacred Word,
And view my Saviour there.


259
Great God, with wonder and with praise

Great God, with wonder and with praise
On all Thy works I look!
But still Thy wisdom, power, and grace,
Shine brightest in Thy book.

The stars that in their courses roll
Have much instruction given;
But Thy good Word informs my soul
How I may rise to heaven.

Here are my choicest treasures hid,
Here my best comfort lies;
Here my desires are satisfied,
And hence my hopes arise.

Then may I love my Bible more,
And take a fresh delight
By day to read these wonders o'er
And meditate by night.


260
Lord, I have made Thy Word my choice,

Lord, I have made Thy Word my choice,
My lasting heritage;
There shall my noblest powers rejoice,
My warmest thoughts engage.

I'll read the histories of Thy love,
And keep Thy laws in sight;
While through the promises I rove
With ever fresh delight.

'Tis a broad land of wealth unknown,
Where springs of life arise,
Seeds of immortal bliss are sown,
And hidden glory lies.

The best relief that mourners have,
It makes our sorrows blest;
Our fairest hope beyond the grave,
And our eternal rest.


261
A glory gilds the sacred page,

A glory gilds the sacred page,
Majestic, like the sun:
It gives a light to every age;
It gives, but borrows none.

The hand that gave it still supplies
The gracious light and heat:
Its truths upon the nations rise;
They rise, but never set.

Let everlasting thanks be Thine
For such a bright display,
As makes a world of darkness shine
With beams of heavenly day.

My soul rejoices to pursue
The steps of Him I love,
Till glory breaks upon my view
In brighter worlds above!


262
An open Bible for the world—

An open Bible for the world—
May this our glorious motto be!
On every breeze its flag unfurled
Shall scatter blessings rich and free.

c
Blest Word of God! ... send forth thy light ...
O'er every land and every sea, ...
Till all who wander in the night ...
Are led to God and heaven by thee.

Where'er it goes its golden light,
Streaming as from an unveiled sun,
Shall dissipate the clouds of night,
Undo the work that sin has done.

It shows to men the Father's face,
All-radiant with forgiving love;
And to the lost of Adam's race
Proclaims sweet mercy from above.

It offers rest to weary hearts;
It comforts those who sit in tears;
To all who faint, it strength imparts,
And gilds with hope th' eternal years.


263
Cling to the Bible, though all else be taken;

Cling to the Bible, though all else be taken;
Lose not its precepts so precious and pure;
Souls that are sleeping its tidings awaken:
Life from the dead in its promises sure.

c
Cling to the Bible! Cling to the Bible!
Cling to the Bible—Our Lamp and our Guide!

Cling to the Bible! this jewel and treasure
Brings life eternal, and saves fallen man;
Surely its value no mortal can measure:
Seek for its blessing, O soul, while you can!

Lamp for the feet that in by-ways have wandered,
Guide for the youth that would otherwise fall;
Hope for the sinner whose life has been squandered,
Staff for the aged, and best book of all.


264
Oh, wonderful, wonderful Word of the Lord!

Oh, wonderful, wonderful Word of the Lord!
True wisdom its pages unfold;
And though we may read them a thousand times o'er,
They never, no, never grow old.
Each line hath a treasure, each promise a pearl,
That all if they will may secure;
And we know that when time and the world pass away,
God's Word shall for ever endure.

Oh, wonderful, wonderful Word of the Lord!
The lamp that our Father above
So kindly has lighted to teach us the way
That leads to the arms of His love!
Its warnings, its counsels, are faithful and just;
Its judgments are perfect and pure;
And we know that when time and the world pass away,
God's Word shall for ever endure.

Oh, wonderful, wonderful Word of the Lord!
Our only salvation is there;
It carries conviction down deep in the heart,
And shows us ourselves as we are
It tells of a Saviour, and points to the cross,
Where pardon we now may secure;
For we know that when time and the world pass away,
God's Word shall for ever endure.

Oh, wonderful, wonderful Word of the Lord!
The hope of our friends in the past;
Its truth where so firmly they anchored their trust,
Through ages eternal shall last.
Oh, wonderful, wonderful Word of the Lord!
Unchanging, abiding, and sure;
For we know that when time and the world pass away,
God's Word shall for ever endure.


265
Now let my soul, eternal King,

Now let my soul, eternal King,
To Thee its grateful tribute bring;
My knee with humble homage bow,
My tongue perform its solemn vow.

All nature sings Thy boundless love,
In worlds below and worlds above;
But in Thy blessed Word I trace
Diviner wonders of Thy grace.

Here Jesus bids my sorrows cease,
And gives my labouring conscience peace;
Here lifts my grateful passions high,
And points to mansions in the sky.

For love like this, oh, let my song
Through endless years Thy praise prolong!
Let distant climes Thy name adore,
Till time and nature are no more.


266
Thanks for Thy Word, O blessed Redeemer!

Thanks for Thy Word, O blessed Redeemer!
Open our eyes its beauty to see;
Grant us Thy grace to study it wisely,
Close every heart to all but Thee.

c
Thanks for the Bible, offering so freely
Pardon and peace to all who believe;
Help us, O Lord, its counsel to follow,
Meekly by faith its truth receive.

Thanks for Thy Word of precept and promise,
Lamp to our feet and light to our way,
Points us afar where pleasures immortal
Bloom in Thine own bright realm of day.

Blessed are they who keep its commandments,
They shall abide for ever with Thee;
Close by the clear and beautiful river,
Sharing the fruits of life's fair tree.


267
Thy Word is a lamp to my feet, O Lord,

Thy Word is a lamp to my feet, O Lord,
Thy Word is a light to my way;
It shines in my soul like a star by night,
And comforts and cheers me by day.

c
wonderful, wonderful Word,
My treasure, my hope, and my stay;
Each promise recorded delights my soul,
And brightens each step of my way.

Thy Word is a lamp to my feet, O Lord,
And, trusting in Thee as my all,
Whatever of evil may cross my path,
I never, no, never can fall.

Thy Word is a lamp to my feet, O Lord;
And oh, when Thy glory I see,
For all the rich blessings its truth has brought,
The praise will I give unto Thee.


268
The heavens declare Thy glory, Lord!

The heavens declare Thy glory, Lord!
In every star Thy wisdom shines;
But when our eyes behold Thy Word,
We read Thy name in fairer lines.

The radiant sun, the changing light,
And nights and days Thy power confess;
But the blest volume Thou hast writ
Reveals Thy justice and Thy grace.

Sun, moon, and stars convey Thy praise
Round the whole earth, and never stand:
So, when Thy truth began its race,
It touched and glanced on every land.

Nor shall Thy spreading Gospel rest,
Till through the world Thy truth has run;
Till Christ has all the nations blest
That see the light or feel the sun.


269
There is a stream, whose gentle flow

There is a stream, whose gentle flow
Supplies the city of our God;
Life, love, and joy, still gliding through,
And watering our divine abode.

That sacred stream — Thy holy Word-
Supports our faith, our fear controls;
Sweet peace Thy promises afford,
And give new strength to tainting souls.

Loud may the troubled ocean roar:
In sacred peace our souls abide;
While every nation, every shore,
Trembles, and dreads the swelling tide.



270
O day of rest and gladness,O day of joy and light;

O day of rest and gladness,
O day of joy and light;
O balm of care and sadness,
Most beautiful, most bright!
On thee the high and lowly
Before th' eternal throne
Sing" Holy, Holy, Holy,"
To God the Three in One!

On Thee at the creation
The light first had its birth;
On thee for our salvation
Christ rose from depths of earth:
On thee our Lord victorious
The Spirit sent from heaven;
And thus on thee most glorious
A triple light was given.

Thou art a cooling fountain
In life's dry, dreary sand;
From thee, like Pisgah's mountain,
We view our promised land;
A day of sweet refection,
A day of holy love,
A day of resurrection
From earth to things above.

To-day on weary nations
The heavenly manna falls;
To holy convocations
The silver trumpet calls,
Where gospel-light is glowing
With pure and radiant beams,
And living water flowing
With soul-refreshing streams.

New graces ever gaining
From this our day of rest,
We reach the rest remaining
To spirits of the blest.
To Holy Ghost be praises,
To Father and to Son;
The Church her voice upraises
To Thee, blest Three in One.


271
How pleased and blest was I

How pleased and blest was I
To hear the people cry:
Come, let us seek our God to-day!
The Lord's Day
Yes, with a cheerful zeal
We haste to Zion's hill,
And there our vows and honours pay.

Zion, thrice happy place,
Adorned with wondrous grace,
And walls of strength embrace thee round;
In thee our tribes appear,
To pray and praise and hear
The sacred Gospel's joyful sound.

There David's greater Son
Has fixed His royal throne-
He sits for grace and judgment there
He bids the saint be glad,
He makes the sinner sad,
And humble souls rejoice with fear.

May peace attend thy gate,
And joy within thee wait
To bless the soul of every guest:
The man that seeks thy peace,
And wishes thine increase,
A thousand blessings on him rest.

My tongue repeats her vows,
Peace to this sacred house!
For there my friends and kindred dwell;
And since my glorious God
Makes thee His blest abode,
My soul shall ever love thee well,


272
This is the day the Lord hath made,

This is the day the Lord hath made,
He calls the hours His own;
Let heaven rejoice, let earth be glad,
And praise surround the throne.

To-day He rose and left the dead,
And Satan's empire fell:
To-day the saints His triumph spread,
And all His wonders tell.

Hosanna to th' anointed King,
To David's holy Son!
Help us, O Lord! descend and bring
Salvation from Thy throne.

Blest be the Lord who comes to men
With messages of grace;
Who comes in God His Father's name
To save our sinful race.

Hosanna, in the highest strains
The Church on earth can raise;
The highest heavens in which He reigns
Shall give Him nobler praise.


273
The dawn of God's dear Sabbath

The dawn of God's dear Sabbath
Breaks o'er the earth again.
As some sweet summer morning
After a night of pain:
It comes as cooling showers
To some exhausted land,
As shade of clustered palm trees
'Mid weary wastes of sand.

O day, when earthly sorrow
Is merged in heavenly joy,
And trial changed to blessing
That foes may not destroy;
When want is turned to fulness,
And weariness to rest;
And pain to wondrous rapture,
Upon the Saviour's breast.

Lord, we would bring for offering,
Though marred with earthly soil,
A week of earnest labour,
Of steady, faithful toil;
Fair fruits of self-denial,
Of strong, deep love to Thee,
Fostered by Thine own Spirit
In our humility.

And we would bring our burden
Of sinful thought and deed,
In Thy pure presence kneeling,
From bondage to be freed;
Our hearts' most bitter sorrow
For all Thy work undone,—
So many talents wasted,
So few bright laurels won!

So be it, Lord, for ever:
Oh, may we evermore,
In Jesus' holy presence,
His blessed name adore:
Upon His peaceful Sabbath,
Within His temple walls,
Type of the stainless worship
In Zion's golden halls;

So that in joy and gladness
We reach that home at last;
When life's short week of sorrow,
And sin, and strife is past;
When angel-hands have gathered
The fair ripe fruit for Thee,
O Father, Lord, Redeemer,
Most Holy Trinity.


274
Lord of the Sabbath! hear our vows

Lord of the Sabbath! hear our vows
On this Thy day, in this Thy house;
And own, as grateful sacrifice,
The songs which from the desert rise.

Thine earthly Sabbaths, Lord, we love;
But there's a nobler rest above:
To that our labouring souls aspire,
With ardent pangs of strong desire.

No more fatigue, no more distress,
Nor sin, nor hell, shall reach the place;
No groans to mingle with the songs
Which warble from immortal tongues.

No rude alarms of raging foes,
No cares to break the long repose:
No midnight shade, no clouded sun,
But sacred, high, eternal noon.

O long-expected day, begin!
Dawn on these realms of woe and sin;
Fain would we leave this weary road,
And sleep in death to rest with God.


275
Sweet is the work, my God, my King,

Sweet is the work, my God, my King,
To praise Thy name, give thanks and sing,
To show Thy love by morning light,
And talk of all Thy truth at night.

Sweet is the day of sacred rest,
No mortal cares can seize my breast;
Oh may my heart in tune be found,
Like David's harp of solemn sound.

My heart shall triumph in the Lord,
And bless His works, and bless His Word;
Thy works of grace, how bright they shine!
How deep Thy counsels, how divine!

Lord, I shall share a glorious part
When grace hath well refined my heart,
And fresh supplies of joy are shed,
Like holy oil, to cheer my head.

Sin, my worst enemy before,
Shall vex my eyes and ears no more;
My inward foes shall all be slain,
Nor Satan break my peace again.

Then shall I see, and hear, and know
All I desired or wished below,
And every power find sweet employ
In that eternal world of joy.


276
Another six days' work is done,

Another six days' work is done,
Another Sabbath is begun;
Return, my soul, enjoy the rest;
Improve the day thy God has blest.

Come, bless the Lord, whose love assigns
So sweet a rest to wearied minds,
Provides an antepast of heaven,
And gives this day the food of seven.

Oh that our thoughts and thanks may
rise As grateful incense to the skies,
And draw from heaven that sweet repose
Which none but he that feels it knows.

This heavenly calm within the breast
Is the dear pledge of glorious rest,
Which for the Church of God remains;
The end of cares, the end of pains.

In holy duties let the day,
In holy pleasures, pass away:
How sweet a Sabbath thus to spend,
In hope of one that ne'er shall end!


277
"Till He come!" Oh, let the words

"Till He come!" Oh, let the words
Linger on the trembling chords;
Let the" little while" between
In their golden light be seen:
Let us think how heaven and home
Lie beyond that" Till He come!"

When the weary ones we love
Enter on their rest above—
Seems the earth so poor and vast?—
All our life-joy overcast?
Hush! be every murmur dumb:
It is only" Till He come I"

Clouds and conflicts round us press;
Would we have one sorrow less?
ll the sharpness of the cross,
All that tells the world is loss—
Death, and darkness, and the tomb—
Only whisper" Till He come!"

See, the feast of love is spread,
Drink the wine and break the bread—
Sweet memorials—till the Lord
Call us round His heavenly board;
Some from earth, from glory some,
Severed only" Till He come!"


278
Jesus! of Thee we ne'er would tire;

Jesus! of Thee we ne'er would tire;
The new and living food
Can satisfy our hearts' desire,
And life is in Thy blood.

If such the happy midnight song
Our prisoned spirits raise,
What are the joys that cause ere long
Eternal bursts of praise?

To look within and see no stain,
Abroad no curse to trace;
To shed no tears, to feel no pain,
But see Thee face to face.

To find each hope of glory gained,
Fulfilled each precious word;
And fully all to have attained
The image of our Lord.


279
Come ye yourselves apart and rest awhile,

Come ye yourselves apart and rest awhile,
Weary, I know it, of the press and throng;
Wipe from your brow the sweat and dust of toil,
And in My quiet strength again be strong.

Come ye aside from all the world holds dear,
For converse which the world has never known;
Alone with Me and with My Father here,
With Me and with My Father not alone.

Come, tell Me all that ye have said and done,
Your victories and failures, hopes and fears;
I know how hardly souls are wooed and won;
My choicest wreaths are always wet with tears.

Come ye and rest: the journey is too great,
And ye will faint beside the way, and sink:
The bread of life is here for you to eat,
And here for you the wine of love to drink.

Then, fresh from converse with your Lord, return
And work till daylight softens into even:
The brief hours are not lost in which ye learn
More of your Master and His rest in heaven.


280
Come, Thou everlasting Spirit,

Come, Thou everlasting Spirit,
Bring to every thankful mind
All the Saviour's dying merit,
All His sufferings for mankind:
True Recorder of His passion,
Now the living faith impart;
Now reveal His great salvation
Unto every faithful heart.

Come, Thou witness of His dying;
Come, Remembrancer Divine;
Let us feel Thy power applying
Christ to every soul, and mine;
Let us groan Thine inward groaning;
Look on Him we pierced, and grieve;
All partake the grace atoning—
All the sprinkled blood receive.

Yes, in me, in me He dwelleth;
I in Him, and He in me!
And my empty soul He filleth,
Here and through eternity.
Thus I wait for His returning,
Singing ail the way to heaven;
Such the joyous song of morning,
Such the banquet song of even.


281
Come, for the feast is spread;Hark to the call!

Come, for the feast is spread;
Hark to the call!
Come to the Living Bread,
Broken for all;
Come to His" house of wine,"
Low on His breast recline;
All that He hath is thine;
Come, sinner, come.

Come where the fountain flows
River of life—
Healing for all thy woes,
Doubting, and strife;
Millions have been supplied,
No one was e'er denied;
Come to the crimson tide,
Come, sinner, come.

Come to the throne of grace,
Boldly draw near;
He who would win the race
Must tarry here;
Whate'er thy want may be
Here is the grace for thee,
Jesus thy only plea:
Come, Christian, come.

Come to the Better Land,
Pilgrim, make haste!
Earth is a foreign strand—
Wilderness waste!
Here are the harps of gold,
Here are the joys untold—
Crowns for the young and old:
Come, pilgrim, come.

Jesus, we come to Thee,
Oh, take us in!
Set Thou our spirits free;
Cleanse us from sin!
Then, in yon land of light,
Clothed in our robes of white,
Resting not day nor night,
Thee will we sing.


282
Thou art coming, O my Saviour Thou art coming,

Thou art coming, O my Saviour
Thou art coming, O my King!
Every tongue Thy name confessing,
Well may we rejoice and sing!
Thou art coming! Rays of glory
Thro' the vail Thy death has rent
Gladden now our pilgrim pathway,
Glory from Thy presence sent.

c
Thou art coming! Thou art coming
We shall meet Thee on Thy way!
Thou art coming! we shall see Thee,
And be like Thee on that day!
Thou art coming! Thou art coming!
Jesus, our beloved Lord!
Oh, the joy to see Thee reigning,
Worshipped, glorified, adored!

Thou art coming! Not a shadow,
Not a mist, and not a tear,
Not a sin, and not a sorrow,
On that sunrise grand and clear:
Thou art coming! Jesus, Saviour,
Nothing else seems worth a thought;
Oh, how marvellous the glory
And the bliss Thy pain hath bought.

Thou art coming! We are waiting
With a" hope" that cannot fail,
Asking not the day or hour,
Anchored safe within the vail.
Thou art coming! At Thy table
We are witnesses for this,
As we meet Thee in communion,
Earnest of our coming bliss.


283
We adore Thee, O Lord, for the wonderful grace

We adore Thee, O Lord, for the wonderful grace
That has kept and preserved us till now;
We hallow Thy goodness, Thy infinite love,
While our hearts in Thy presence we bow.

c
In accordance to-day with Thy blessed command,
We commune at Thy Table with Thee,
Recalling the words that to us Thou hast said,
"Do this in remembrance of Me."

Though unworthy to eat of Thy life giving bread,
Or to gather the crumbs as they fall;
We come through Thy merit and take of the feast,
In Thy mercy provided for all.

May our strength be renewed and our souls be impressed
With the scenes that by faith we behold;
And show forth the death of the Lord till He come,
And we rest in Thy glory untold.


284
Sit down beneath His shadow,And rest with great

Sit down beneath His shadow,
And rest with great delight;
The faith that now beholds Him
Is pledge of future sight.

Our Master's love remember,
Exceeding great and free;
Lift up thy heart in gladness,
For He remembers thee.

Bring every weary burden,
Thy sin, thy fear, thy grief;
He calls the heavy laden,
And gives them kind relief.

A little while, though parted,
Remember, wait, and love;
Until He comes in glory,
Until we meet above:

Till in the Father's Kingdom
The heavenly feast is spread;
And we behold His beauty,
Whose blood for us was shed!


285
Jesus, Thou joy of loving hearts,

Jesus, Thou joy of loving hearts,
Thou Fount of life, Thou Light of men,
From the best bliss that earth imparts,
We turn unfilled to Thee again.

Thy truth unchanged hath ever stood;
Thou savest those that on Thee call;
To them that seek Thee, Thou art good,
To them that find Thee, all in all.

We taste Thee, O Thou living Bread,
And long to feast upon Thee still;
We drink of Thee, the Fountain Head,
And thirst our souls from Thee to fill.

Our restless spirits yearn for Thee
Where'er our changeful lot is cast;
Glad, when Thy gracious smile we see;
Blest, when our faith can hold Thee fast.

O Jesus, ever with us stay;
Make all our moments calm and bright;
Chase the dark night of sm away:
Shed o'er the world Thy holy light.


286
SAVIOUR, breathe an evening blessing,

SAVIOUR, breathe an evening blessing,
Ere repose our spirits seal:
Sin and want we come confessing;
Thou canst save, and Thou canst heal.

Though destruction walk around us,
Though the arrow past us fiy;
Angel guards from Thee surround us:
We are safe if Thou art nigh.

Though the night be dark and dreary,
Darkness cannot hide from Thee;
Thou art He who, never weary,
Watchest where Thy people be.

Should swift death this night o'ertake us,
And our couch become our tomb,
May the morn in heaven awake us,
Clad in light and deathless bloom!


287
Lord, dismiss us with Thy blessing,

Lord, dismiss us with Thy blessing,
Fill our hearts with joy and peace;
Let us each, Thy love possessing,
Triumph in redeeming grace.
Oh, refresh us, oh, refresh us.
Travelling through this wilderness.

Thanks we give, and adoration,
For Thy gospel's joyful sound;
May the fruits of Thy salvation
In our hearts and lives abound.
Ever faithful, ever faithful
To the truth may we be found.

So, whene'er the signal's given
Us from earth to call away,
Borne on angels' wings to heaven,
Glad the summons to obey,
May we ever, may we ever,
Reign with Christ in endless day.


288
Father, in high heaven dwelling,

Father, in high heaven dwelling,
May our evening song be telling
Of Thy mercy large and free:
Through the day Thy love has fed us,
Through the day Thy care has led us,
With divinest charity.

This day's sins, oh pardon, Saviour,
Evil thoughts, perverse behaviour,
Envy, pride, and vanity:
From the world, the flesh, deliver—
Save us now, and save us ever,
O Thou Lamb of Calvary!

From enticements of the devil,
From the might of spirits evil,
Be our shield and panoply:
Let Thy power this night defend us,
And a heavenly peace attend us,
And angelic company.

Whilst the night-dews are distilling,
Holy Ghost, each heart be filling
With Thine own serenity:
Softly let the eyes be closing,
Loving souls on Thee reposing,
Ever blessed Trinity!


289
Silently the shades of evening

Silently the shades of evening
Gather round my lonely door;
Silently they bring before me
Faces I shall see no more.

Oh, not lost, but gone before us!
Let them never be forgot:
Sweet their memory to the lonely;
In our hearts they perish not.

How such holy memories cluster,
Like the stars when storms are past;
Pointing up to that far heaven,
Where we hope to meet at last.


290
At evening time may there be light,

At evening time may there be light,
While life's brief day is closing;
Then shall I fear no gathering night,
In Jesus' love reposing.

At evening time may there be light,
The light of life eternal;
The radiance of those mansions bright,
In climes for ever vernal,

At evening time there shall be light,
Earth's day of storm is dying;
Sorrow and sadness take their flight,
There shall be no more sighing.

At evening time there shall be light,
The twilight skies adorning;
But oh, how fair the radiance bright
Of that swift-speeding morning.


291
Saviour, again to Thy dear name we raise

Saviour, again to Thy dear name we raise
With one accord our parting hymn of praise:
We rise to bless Thee ere our worship cease;
And now, departing, wait Thy word of peace.

Grant us Thy peace upon our homeward way;
With Thee began, with Thee shall end the day;
Guard Thou the lips from sin, the hearts from shame,
That in this house have called upon Thy name.

Grant us Thy peace, Lord, through the coming night;
Turn Thou for us its darkness into light;
From harm and danger keep Thy children free,
For dark and light are both alike to Thee.

Grant us Thy peace throughout our earthly life,
Our balm in sorrow, and our stay in strife;
Then, when Thy voice shall bid our conflict cease,
Call us, O Lord, to Thine eternal peace.


292
Day is dying in the west,Heaven is touching earth

Day is dying in the west,
Heaven is touching earth with rest;
Wait and worship while the night
Sets her evening lamps alight
Through all the sky.

c
Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of hosts
Heaven and earth are full of Thee!
Heaven and earth are praising Thee,
O Lord most high!

Lord of life, beneath the dome
Of the universe, Thy home,
Gather us, who seek Thy face,
To the fold of Thy embrace,
For Thou art nigh.

While the deepening shadows fall,
Heart of Love, enfolding all,
Through the glory and the grace
Of the stars that veil Thy face,
Our hearts ascend.

When for ever from our sight
Pass the stars, the day, the night,
Lord of angels, on our eyes
Let eternal morning rise,
And shadows end.


293
Once more at rest, my peaceful

Once more at rest, my peaceful thoughts are blending;
Once more, O Lord, Thy loving smile I see;
For softly now the twilight shades descending
Have closed, and left my heart alone with Thee.

c
Still, still I hear Thy words of consolation
That gave me hope when I was sorely tried;
And since that hour of hallowed meditation,
Thy counsel, Lord, has been my only guide.

Once more at rest, my cares awhile forsaking,
I thank Thee, Lord, for victories I have won;
For strength and grace, when earthly ties were breaking,
To trust in Thee, and say,"Thy will be done."

Once more at rest, I view the silent river,
Whose placid waves Thy love will bear me o'er;
There, home at last, my raptured soul for ever
Will fold her wings, where sorrow comes no more.


294
Stealing from the world away,

Stealing from the world away,
We are come to seek Thy face;
Kindly meet us, Lord, we pray;
Grant us Thy reviving grace.

Yonder stars that gild the sky
Shine with but a borrowed light;
We, unless Thy light be nigh,
Wander wrapt in gloomy night.

Sun of Righteousness, dispel
All our darkness, doubts, and fears;
May Thy light within us dwell
Till eternal day appears!


295
"The Lord bless thee, and keep thee:

"The Lord bless thee, and keep thee:
The Lord make His face shine upon thee,
And be gracious unto thee,
And be gracious unto thee:
The Lord lift up His countenance,
His countenance upon thee,
And give thee peace." . . .


296
Now the day is over,

Now the day is over,
Night is drawing nigh,
Shadows of the evening
Steal across the sky.

Jesus, give the weary
Calm and sweet repose;
With Thy tenderest blessing
May our eyelids close.

Through the long night-watches
May Thine angels spread
Their white wings above us,
Watching round each bed.

When the morning wakens,
Then may I arise
Pure, and fresh, and sinless
In Thy holy eyes.

Glory to the Father,
Glory to the Son,
And to Thee, blest Spirit,
Whilst all ages run.


297
Abide with me: fast falls the eventide;

Abide with me: fast falls the eventide;
The darkness deepens; Lord, with me abide:
When other helpers fail, and comforts flee,
Help of the helpless, oh, abide with me!

Swift to its close ebbs out life's little day;

Earth's joys grow dim, its glories pass away;
Change and decay in all around I see;
O Thou, who changest not, abide with me!

Come not in terrors, as the King of kings;
But kind and good, with healing in Thy wings;
Tears for all woes, a heart for every plea;
Come, Friend of sinners, thus abide with me.

I need Thy presence every passing hour;
What but Thy grace can foil the tempter's power?
Who like Thyself my guide and stay can be?
Through cloud and sunshine, oh,abide with me!

I fear no foe, with Thee at hand to bless:
Ills have no weight, and tears no bitterness:
Where is death's sting? where, grave, thy victory?
I triumph still, if Thou abide with me.

Be Thou Thyself before my closingeyes;
Shine through the gloom, and point me to the skies;
Heaven's morning breaks, and earth's vain shadows flee;
In life, in death, O Lord, abide with me!


298
God be with you till we meet again!—

God be with you till we meet again!—
By His counsels guide, uphold you,
With His sheep securely fold you;
God be with you till we meet again!

c
Till we meet! . . . Till we meet! . . .
Till we meet at Jesus' feet; . . .
Till we meet! . . . Till we meet! . ...
God be with you till we meet again!

God be with you till we meet again!—
'Neath His wings securely hide you,
Daily manna still provide you;
God be with you till we meet again!

God be with you till we meet again!—
When life's perils thick confound you,
Put His loving arms around you;
God be with you till we meet again!

God be with you till we meet again!—
Keep love's banner floating o'er you,
Smite death's threatening wave before you;
God be with you till we meet again!


299
Jesus, Saviour, on Thy breast

Jesus, Saviour, on Thy breast
I would lay me down to rest;
While mine eyelids gently close,
Thou wilt grant me calm repose.

c
May Thine angels vigil keep
While I lay me down to sleep.

Lord, this wayward heart forgive,
Teach me more like Thee to live;
Every evil thought subdue;
May Thy grace my strength renew.

When the day of life is past,
And the twilight comes at last,
When I cross the narrow sea,
I shall still abide in Thee.


300
Lord, keep us safe this night,

Lord, keep us safe this night,
Secure from all our fears;
May angels guard us while we sleep,
Till morning light appears. Amen.


301
Glory to Thee, my God, this night,

Glory to Thee, my God, this night,
For all the blessings of the light;
Keep me, oh, keep me, King of kings,
Beneath Thine own almighty wings.

Forgive me, Lord, for Thy dear Son,
The ill that I this day have done;
That with the world, myself, and Thee,
I, ere I sleep, at peace may be.

Teach me to live, that I may dread
The grave as little as my bed;
Teach me to die, that so I may
Rise glorious at the Judgment Day.

Oh, let my soul on Thee repose,
And may sweet sleep mine eyelids close;
Sleep, that shall me more vigorous make
To serve my God when I awake.


302
Sun of my soul, Thou Saviour dear,

Sun of my soul, Thou Saviour dear,
It is not night if Thou be near;
Oh, may no earth-born cloud arise,
To hide Thee from Thy servant's eyes!

When the soft dews of kindly sleep
My wearied eyelids gently steep,
Be my last thought—How sweet to rest
For ever on my Saviour's breast!

Abide with me from morn till eve,
For without Thee I cannot live;
Abide with me when night is nigh,
For without Thee I dare not die.

If some poor wandering child of Thine
Have spurned to-day the voice Divine,
Now, Lord, the gracious work begin;
Let him no more lie down in sin.

Come near and bless us when we wake,
Ere through the world our way we take;
Till, in the ocean of Thy love,
We lose ourselves in heaven above.


303
Tis the blessed hour of prayer,

Tis the blessed hour of prayer, when
our hearts lowly bend,
And we gather to Jesus, our
Saviour and Friend;
If we come to Him in faith, His
protection to share,
What a balm for the weary! Oh,
how sweet to be there!

c
Blessed hour of prayer!
Blessed hour of prayer!
What a balm for the weary!
Oh, how sweet to be there!

Tis the blessed hour of prayer,when
the Saviour draws near,
With tender compassion His people to hear;

When He tells us we may cast at His
feet every care,
What a balm for the weary!
Oh, how sweet to be there!

'Tis the blessed hour of prayer, when
the tempted and tried,
To the Saviour who loves them their
sorrows confide:
With a sympathising heart
He removes every care;
What a balm for the weary! Oh,
how sweet to be there!

At the blessed hour of prayer, if
we firmly believe
That the blessing we ask for
we'll surely receive,
In the fulness of delight
we shall lose every care;
What a balm for the weary!
Oh, how sweet to be there!


304
Let us sing of the wonderful mercy of God,

Let us sing of the wonderful
mercy of God,
Of His constant protection and care;
Let our fervent devotions
like incense arise,
When we gather before Him in prayer.

c
Let us praise and adore Him
for all He hath done,
Let us tell of His goodness and care;
Let our fervent devotions
like incense arise,
When we gather before Him in prayer.

Let us sing of the wonderful
gift of His grace,
That to us He has tenderly shown;
In the blessed communion
with Jesus His Son,
That has brought us so
near to His throne.

Let us pray that His blessing
may follow us still,
That His light on our pathway may shine;
And at last that our spirits
made perfect in Him
May inherit His kingdom divine.


305
Pray on, pray on, believing ones,

Pray on, pray on, believing ones,
God's promised word is sure,
That they shall overcome by faith
Who to the end endure;
Pray on, pray on; oh, weary not,
The cross with patience bear;
And though its burdens weigh us down,
The Lord will answer prayer.

His eye foresees our greatest good,
While we at best are weak;
And thus in wisdom He withholds
The boon that oft we seek:
And yet His all-sufficient grace
He bids us freely share,
And in a way we little know
The Lord will answer prayer.

With anxious thoughts for those we love
How oft our hearts are filled!
But soon the clouds are rolled away,
The troubled waves are stilled:
Then murmur not, but trust in Him
Who knows our every care—
And better far than we can ask,
The Lord will answer prayer.


306
"There shall be showers of blessing":

"There shall be showers of blessing":
This is the promise of love;
There shall be seasons refreshing,
Sent from the Saviour above.

c
Show - - ers of blessing,
Showers of blessing we need;
Mercy-drops round us are falling,
But for the showers we plead.

"There shall be showers of blessing"—
Precious reviving again;
Over the hills and the valleys,
Sound of abundance of rain.

"There shall be showers of blessing"
Send them upon us, O Lord!:
Grant to us now a refreshing;
Come, and now honour Thy Word.

"There shall be showers of blessing":
Oh that to-day they might fall,
Now as to God we're confessing,
Now as on Jesus we call!


307
God is here, and that to bless us

God is here, and that to bless us
With the Spirit's quickening power;
See, the cloud already bending
Waits to drop the grateful shower.

c
Let it come, . . O Lord, we pray Thee!
Let the shower . . of blessing fall!
We are wait - - ing, we are waiting!
Oh revive . . the hearts of all!

God is here! we feel His presence
In this consecrated place;
But we need the soul refreshing
Of His free, unbounded grace.

God is here! oh, then believing,
Bring to Him our one desire,
That His love may now be kindled,
Till its flame each heart inspire.

Saviour, grant the prayer we offer
While in simple faith we bow;
From the windows of Thy mercy
Pour us out a blessing now.


308
Oh, welcome, hour of prayer! So full of peace and rest!

Oh, welcome, hour of prayer!
So full of peace and rest!
Here we may cast our every care
Upon the Saviour's breast;
We leave the world without,
To sit at Jesus' feet;
His love can banish every doubt,
And make our joys complete.

We see each other's face,
And take each other's hand;
We sing our hymns of saving grace,
And of the Better Land;
And while we feast with Him
Who is the Truth, the Light,
May we again our lamps retrim,
To shine forth in the night.

Thrice welcome, precious hour,
Of faith, and hope, and love,
When we may feel the Spirit's power
Descending from above!
He dries the falling tears
That will, unbidden, start;
He scatters all our anxious fears,
And fills each waiting heart.

O Thou that hearest prayer!
How sad this life would be—
How hard each heavy cross to bear,
Could we not come to Thee!
When faith seems lost in fear,
And hopes are dimmed by care,
In Thee we find refreshing cheer,
Thou blessed hour of prayer!


309
Revive Thy work, O Lord! Now to Thy saints appear!

Revive Thy work, O Lord!
Now to Thy saints appear!
Oh, speak with power to every soul,
And let Thy people hear!

c
Revive Thy work, O Lord! . .
While here to Thee we bow; . .
Descend, O gracious Lord, descend!
Oh come, and bless us now!

Revive Thy work, O Lord!
Exalt Thy precious name!
And may Thy love in every heart
Be kindled to a flame!

Revive Thy work, O Lord!
And bless to all Thy word!
And may its pure and sacred truth
In living faith be heard!

Revive Thy work, O Lord!
Give pentecostal showers!
Be Thine the glory, Thine alone!
The blessing, Lord, be ours!


310
Faith is a living power from heaven

Faith is a living power from heaven
Which grasps the promise God has given;
Securely fixed on Christ alone,
A trust that cannot be o'erthrown.

Faith finds in Christ whate'er we need
To save and strengthen, guide and feed;
Strong in His grace, it joys to share
His cross, in hope His crown to wear.

Faith to the conscience whispers peace,
And bids the mourner's sighing cease;
By faith the children's right we claim,
And call upon our Father's name.

Such faith in us, O God, implant,
And to our prayers Thy favour grant,
In Jesus Christ, Thy saving Son,
Who is our fount of health alone.


311
What various hindrances we meet

What various hindrances we meet
In coming to the mercy-seat!
Yet who, that knows the worth of prayer,
But wishes to be often there!

Prayer makes the darkened clouds withdraw,
Prayer climbs the ladder Jacob saw,
Gives exercise to faith and love,
Brings every blessing from above.

Restraining prayer, we cease to fight;
Prayer makes the Christian's armour bright;
And Satan trembles when he sees
The weakest saint upon his knees.


312
Once more, O Lord, we pray! Put Thy strong armour on;

Once more, O Lord, we pray!
Put Thy strong armour on;
Strike down the shield of Satan's power;
Let victory be won!

c
Once more, O Lord, once more
Thy blessing we implore;
In Thy great name let victory sweep
Through Zion's gates once more.

Lord Jesus, come to-day!
Let souls before Thee bow;
Be this Thine hour of triumph, Lord;
Oh, send salvation now!

Lord Jesus, come and reign!
Let error's empire fall;
We long to see Thy glory shine,
And crown Thee Lord of all!


313
O Thou that hearest prayer! Attend our humble cry;

O Thou that hearest prayer!
Attend our humble cry;
And let Thy servants share
Thy blessing from on high:
We plead the promise of Thy Word;
Grant us Thy Holy Spirit, Lord!

If earthly parents hear
Their children when they cry;
If they, with love sincere,
Their children's wants supply:
Much more wilt Thou Thy love display,
And answer when Thy children pray.

Our heavenly Father Thou;
We—children of Thy grace;
Oh, let Thy Spirit now
Descend and fill the place:
That all may feel the heavenly flame,
And all unite to praise Thy name.


314
My God, is any hour so sweet,

My God, is any hour so sweet,
From blush of mora to evening star,
As that which calls me to Thy feet —
The hour of prayer?

Then is my strength by Thee renewed;
Then are my sins by Thee forgiven;
Then dost Thou cheer my solitude,
With hopes of heaven.

No words can tell what sweet relief
Here for my every want I find:
What strength for warfare, balm for grief,
What peace of mind!

Hushed is each doubt, gone every fear;
My spirit seems in heaven to stay;
And e'en the penitential tear
Is wiped away.

Lord, till I reach yon blissful shore,
No privilege so dear shall be
As thus my inmost soul to pour
In prayer to Thee.


315
For the tempted, Lord, we pray;

For the tempted, Lord, we pray;
For the souls that go astray;
Weak and weary, tempest-tost,
Stars all hid, and compass lost;
Sailors on the dangerous seas—
God of love, we pray for these.

For the tempted, Lord, we pray;
Thou didst make them, Thine are they;
When alluring forms are nigh,
When a thousand voices cry,
Loud and clear above them all
Let them hear Thy tender call.

For the tempted, Lord, we pray;
For the souls that go astray,
Beaten back by storm and sleet,
Scorned by all they chance to meet;
On them let Thy mercy shine,
Still remember they are Thine.

For the tempted, Lord, we pray;
Dust and ashes—such are they!
Hear them while they make their moan;
Thou canst save, and Thou alone:
See, their feet are on the sands;
Christ of Calvary, hold their hands.


316
Sweet the moments, rich in blessing,

Sweet the moments, rich in blessing,
Which before the cross we spend;
Life, and health, and peace possessing,
From the sinner's dying Friend.

Truly blessed is this station,
Low before His cross to lie.
While we see Divine compassion
Beaming in His gracious eye.

Love and grief our hearts dividing,
With our tears His feet we bathe,
Constant still in faith abiding,
Life deriving from His death.

For Thy sorrows we adore Thee,
For the pains that wrought our peace,
Gracious Saviour, we implore Thee
In our souls Thy love increase.


317
Father, before Thy throne My soul would bow;

Father, before Thy throne
My soul would bow;
Ne'er have I asked in vain,
Oh, hear me now:
Hear Thou the prayer I make,
Answer for Jesus' sake;
Bid faith and love awake
Within my heart.

Father, this heart of mine,
Which now I bring,
Lies down before Thy feet,
A guilty thing;
Kindle its altar fire,
Then hope and zeal inspire;
Wake Thou its silent lyre
In praise to Thee.

Thou art our dwelling-place
In every age;
In Thy sweet love we trace
Our heritage—
Our refuge from the storm,
Our shelter safe and warm;
Help us our vows perform,
Father Divine.


318
Sweet hour of prayer! sweet hour of prayer!

Sweet hour of prayer! sweet
hour of prayer!
That calls me from a world of care,
And bids me at my Father's throne
Make all my wants and wishes known.
In seasons of distress and grief,
My soul has often found relief,
And oft escaped the tempter's snare,
By thy return, sweet hour of prayer!

Sweet hour of prayer! sweet hour of prayer!
Thy wings shall my petition bear
To Him whose truth and faithfulness
Engage the waiting soul to bless;
And since He bids me seek His face,
Believe His word, and trust His grace,
I'll cast on Him my every care,
And wait for thee, sweet hour of prayer!

Sweet hour of prayer! sweet hour of prayer!
May I thy consolation share,
Till, from Mount Pisgah's lofty height,
I view my home and take my flight.
This robe of flesh I'll drop, and rise
To seize the everlasting prize;
And shout, while passing through the air
Farewell, farewell, sweet hour of prayer!"


319
What a Friend we have in Jesus,

What a Friend we have in Jesus,
All our sins and griefs to bear!
What a privilege to carry
Everything to God in prayer!
Oh, what peace we often forfeit,
Oh, what needless pain we bear—
All because we do not carry
Everything to God in prayer!

Have we trials and temptations?
Is there trouble anywhere?
We should never be discouraged;
Take it to the Lord in prayer.
Can we find a Friend so faithful,
Who will all our sorrows share?
Jesus knows our every weakness—
Take it to the Lord in prayer!

Are we weak and heavy-laden,
Cumbered with a load of care?
Precious Saviour, still our refuge—
Take it to the Lord in prayer.
Do thy friends despise, forsake thee?
Take it to the Lord in prayer;
In His arms He'll take and shield thee.
Thou wilt find a solace there,


320
'Tis the hallowed hour of prayer,

'Tis the hallowed hour of prayer,
And we trustingly bring
All our doubtings and our fears
To our Saviour and King;
For we know that He delights
A glad welcome to give,
And the blessings that we ask for
We shall fully receive.

c
Precious hour of prayer!
Hallowed hour of prayer!
Sacred season of communion,
It is sweet to be there!


'Tis the precious hour of prayer,
And we humbly entreat:
Father, breathe the Spirit now,
As we bow at Thy feet;
Touch our lips with power of song;
Fill our souls with Thy love.
And bestow the benediction
Of Thy peace from above.

'Tis the sacred hour of prayer,
Calm as heaven above;
Soul to soul is breathing here
The communion of love;
Every heart is sweetly filled
With a peace most profound;
Oh, the place is like to heaven
Where such true joys abound.


321
How sweet the hour of praise and prayer,

How sweet the hour of praise and prayer,
When our devotions blend,
And on ihs wings of faith divine,
Our scngs of joy ascend!
'Tis then we hear in tones more clear
The gracious promise given,
That, though we part from friends on earth,
We all shall meet in heaven.

We all shall meet in heaven at last,
We all shall meet in heaven;
Through faith in Jesus' precious blood,
We all shall meet in heaven.

How sweet the tie of hallowed love
That binds our hearts in one;
When gathered in the blessed name
Of Christ, the Father's Son!
And though the parting soon may come,
Yet in His Word is given
The blessed hope that by and by
We ail shall meet in heaven.

Yes, soon our worn and weary feet
Will reach the golden strand,
Where those we love our coming wait
In yonder summer land;
A few more days, a few more years,
By storm and tempest driven,
With songs and everlasting joy,
We all shall meet in heaven.


322
O Lord, Thy work revive,In Zion's gloomy hour;

O Lord, Thy work revive,
In Zion's gloomy hour;
And make her dying graces live
By Thy restoring power.

Awake Thy chosen few
To fervent, earnest prayer;
Again may they their vows renew,
Thy blessed presence share

Thy Spirit then will speak
Through lips of feeble clay;
And hearts of adamant will break,
And rebels will obey.

Lord, lend Thy gracious ear;
Oh, listen to our cry;
Oh come, and bring salvation here:
Our hopes on Thee rely.


323
Lord God, the Holy Ghost,In this accepted hour,

Lord God, the Holy Ghost,
In this accepted hour,
As on the day of Pentecost,
Descend in all Thy power.

We meet with one accord
In our appointed place,
And wait the promise of our Lord,
The Spirit of all grace.

The young, the old, inspire
With wisdom from above,
And give us hearts and tongues of fire
To pray, and praise, and love.

Spirit of Light, explore
And chase our gloom away,
With lustre shining more and more
Unto the perfect day!


324
Lord, we gather in Thy name;

Lord, we gather in Thy name;
May we now Thy promise claim;
Grant Thy presence from above,
And fill our souls with love.

c
Lord, we come on bended knee,
Looking up by faith to Thee:
Thou, on whom we cast our care,
Bless tnis hour of prayer!


Welcome hour that ever brings
Peace and gladness on its wings;
Hallowed rest and calm repose
Thy tranquil joy bestows.

Now to us Thy grace impart,
Nearer draw each waiting heart;
Consecrate us all Thine own,
While here before Thy throne.


325
Here from the world we turn, Jesus to seek;

Here from the world we turn,
Jesus to seek;
Here may His loving voice
Tenderly speak!
Jesus, our dearest Friend,
While at Thy feet we bend,
Oh, let Thy smile descend!
'Tis Thee we seek.

Come, Holy Comforter,
Presence divine.
Now in our longing hearts
Graciously shine;
Oh for Thy mighty power!
Oh for a blessed shower,
Filling this hallowed hour
With joy divine!

Saviour, Thy work revive,
Here may we see
Those who are dead in sin
Quickened by Thee;
Come to our hearts' delight,
Make every burden light,
Cheer Thou our waiting sight;
We long for Thee.


326
Come, Thou Desire of all Thy saints!

Come, Thou Desire of all Thy saints!
Our humble strains attend;
While with our praises and cornplaints,
Low at Thy feet we bend,

How should our songs, like those above,
With warm devotion rise!
How should our souls, on wings of love,
Mount upward to the skies!

Come, Lord! Thy love alone can raise
In us the heavenly flame;
Then shall our lips resound Thy praise,
Our hearts adore Thy name.

Dear Saviour, let Thy glory shine,
And fill Thy dwellings here;
Till life, and love, and joy divine
A heaven on earth appear.


327
Oh for a faith that will not shrink,

Oh for a faith that will not shrink,
Though pressed by every foe;
That will not tremble on the brink
Of any earthly woe:

That will not murmur or complain
Beneath the chastening rod;
But in the hour of grief or pain
Will lean upon its God:

A faith that shines more bright and clear
When tempests rage without;
That when in danger knows no fear,
In darkness feels no doubt—

A faith that keeps the narrow way
Till life's last spark is fled,
And with a pure and heavenly ray
Lights up the dying bed.

Lord, give us such a faith as this,
And then, whate'er may come,
We'll taste, e'en here, the hallowed bliss
Of our eternal home!


328
Hear us, O Saviour, while we pray,

Hear us, O Saviour, while we pray,
Humbly our need confessing;
Grant us the promised showers today—
Send them upon us, O Lord!

c
Send showers of blessing; send showers refreshing;
Send us showers of blessing; send them, Lord,we pray!

Knowing Thy love, on Thee we call,
Boldly Thy throne addressing;
Pleading that showers of grace may fall—
Send them upon us, O Lord!

Trusting Thy Word that cannot fail,
Master, we claim Thy promise;
Oh that our faith may now prevail—
Send us the showers, O Lord!


329
Jesus, we Thy promise claim, We are gathered

Jesus, we Thy promise claim,
We are gathered in Thy name;
In the midst do Thou appear;
Manifest Thy presence here.

Sanctify us, Lord, and bless;
Breathe Thy Spirit, give Thy peace;
Come and dwell within each heart;
Light, and life, and joy impart.

Make us all in Thee complete,
Make us all for glory meet—
Meet t' appear before Thy sight;
Partners with the saints in light!


330
Come, my soul, thy suit prepare;

Come, my soul, thy suit prepare;
Jesus loves to answer prayer:
He Himself has bid thee pray,
Therefore will not say thee nay.

Thou art coming to a King:
Large petitions with thee bring;
For His grace and power are such,
None can ever ask too much.

With my burden I begin—
Lord, remove this load of sin;
Let thy blood, for sinners spilt,
Set my conscience free from guilt.

Lord, I come to Thee for rest-
Take possession of my breast,
There Thy blood-bought right maintain,
And without a rival reign.

While I am a pilgrim here
Let Thy love my spirit cheer;
As my Guide, my Guard, my Friend,
Lead me to my journey's end.

Show me what I have to do,
Every hour my strength renew;
Let me live a life of faith,
Let me die Thy people's death.


331
Lord, we come before Thee now,

Lord, we come before Thee now,
At Thy feet we humbly bow;
Oh, do not our suit disdain!
Shall we seek Thee, Lord, in vain?

Lord, on Thee our souls depend;
In compassion now descend:
Fill our hearts with Thy rich grace,
Tune our lips to sing Thy praise.

In Thine own appointed way
Now we seek Thee; here we stay:
Lord, we know not how to go,
Till a blessing Thou bestow.

Send some message from Thy Word
That may joy and peace afford;
Let Thy Spirit now impart
Full salvation to each heart.

Comfort those who weep and mourn;
Let the time of joy return;
Those that are cast down lift up;
Make them strong in faith and hope.

Grant that all may seek and find
Thee a God supremely kind:
Heal the sick; the captive free;
Let us all rejoice in Thee.


332
Pray, always pray; the Holy Spirit pleads

Pray, always pray; the Holy Spirit pleads
Within thee all thy daily, hourly needs.
Pray, always pray; beneath sin's heaviest load
Prayer sees the blood from Jesus' side that flowed.

Pray, always pray, though weary, faint, and lone,
Prayer nestles by the Father's sheltering throne.

Pray, always pray; amid the world's turmoil
Prayer keeps the heart at rest, and nerves for toil.

Pray, always pray; if joys thy pathway throng,
Prayer strikes the harp, and sings the angels' song.

Pray, always pray; if loved ones pass the veil,
Prayer drinks with them of springs that cannot fail.

All earthly things with earth shall fade away;
Prayer grasps eternity: pray, always pray.


333
Lord, teach us how to pray aright,

Lord, teach us how to pray aright,
With reverence and with fear;
Though dust and ashes in Thy sight,
We may, we must draw near.

Burdened with guilt, convinced of sin,
In weakness, want, and woe,
Fightings without, and fears within,
Lord, whither shall we go?

God of all grace, we come to Thee
With broken, contrite hearts;
Give, what Thine eye delights to see,
Truth in the inward parts.

Give deep humility; the sense
Of godly sorrow give;
A strong, desiring confidence
To hear Thy voice and live;

Faith in the holy sacrifice
That can for sin atone;
To cast our hopes, to rix our eyes,
On Christ, on Christ alone;

Patience to watch, and wait, and weep,
Though mercy long delay;
Courage, our fainting souls to keep,
And trust Thee, though Thou slay:

Give these, and then Thy will be done;
Thus strengthened with all might,
We by Thy Spirit, and Thy Son,
Shall pray, and pray aright.


334
So near to the Kingdom! yet what dost thou lack?

So near to the Kingdom! yet what dost thou lack?
So near to the Kingdom! what keepeth thee back?
Renounce every idol, though dear it may be,
And come to the Saviour now pleading with thee!

c
Plead - - ing with thee! . . .
The Saviour is pleading, is pleading with thee!

So near, that thou hearest the songs that resound
From those who, believing, a pardon have found!
So near, yet unwilling to give up thy sin,
When Jesus is waiting to welcome thee in.

To die with no hope! hast thou counted the cost?—
To die out of Christ, and thy soul to be lost?
So near to the Kingdom! oh come, we implore!
While Jesus is pleading, come enter the door!


335
Oh, do not let the Word depart,

Oh, do not let the Word depart,
Nor close thine eyes against the light;
Poor sinner, harden not thy heart:
Thou wouldst be saved—Why not to- night?

c
Why not to-night? Why not to-night?
Thou wouldst be saved—Why not to-night?

To-morrow's sun may never rise,
To bless thy long-deluded sight;
This is the time! oh then, be wise!
Thou wouldst be saved—Why not to- night?

The world has nothing left to give—
It has no new, no pure delight:
Oh, try the life which Christians live!
Thou wouldst be saved— Why not to- night?

Our blessed Lord refuses none
Who would to Him their souls unite;
Then be the work of grace begun!
Thou wouldst be saved— Why not to- night?


336
While Jesus whispers to you,

While Jesus whispers to you,
Come, sinner, come!
While we are praying for you,
Come, sinner, come!
Now is the time to own Him,
Come, sinner, come!
Now is the time to know Him,
Come, sinner, come!

Are you too heavy laden?
Come, sinner, come!
Jesus will bear your burden,
Come, sinner, come!
Jesus will not deceive you,
Come, sinner, come!
Jesus will now receive you,
Come, sinner, come!

Oh, hear His tender pleading!
Come, sinner, come!
Come, and receive the blessing!
Come, sinner, come!
While Jesus whispers to you,
Come, sinner, come!
While we are praying for you,
Come, sinner, come!


337
Weeping will not save me!

Weeping will not save me!
Though my face were bathed in tears,
That could not allay my fears,
Could not wash the sins of years:
Weeping will not save me!

c
Jesus wept and died for me;
Jesus suffered on the tree;
Jesus waits to make me free:
He alone can save me!

Working will not save me!
Purest deeds that I can do,
Holiest thoughts and feelings too,
Cannot form my soul anew:
Working will not save me!

Waiting will not save me!
Helpless, guilty, lost, I lie;
In my ear is Mercy's cry;
If I wait I can but die:
Waiting will not save me!

Faith in Christ will save me!
Let me trust Thy weeping Son,
Trust the work that He has done;
To His arms, Lord, help me run:
Faith in Christ will save me!


338
Someone will enter the pearly gate

Someone will enter the pearly gate
By and by, by and by;
Taste of the glories that there await:
Shall you? shall I?
Someone will travel the streets of gold,
Beautiful visions will there behold,
Feast on the pleasures so long foretold:
Shall you? shall I?

Someone at last will his cross lay down
By and by, by and by;
Faithful, approved, shall receive a crown:
Shall you? shall I?
Someone the glorious King will see,
Ever from sorrow of earth be free,
Happy with Him through eternity:
Shall you? shall I?

Someone will knock when the door is shut—
By and by, by and by;
Hear a voice saying, "I know you not":
Shall you? shall I?
Someone will call and shall not be heard,

Vainly will strive when the door is barred,
Someone will fail of the saint's reward:
Shall you? shall I?

Someone will sing the triumphant song
By and by, by and by;
Join in the praise with the blood-bought throng:
Shall you? shall I?
Someone will greet on the golden shore
Loved ones of earth who have gone before,
Safe in the glory for evermore:
Shall you? shall I?


339
God calling yet! shall I not hear?

God calling yet! shall I not hear?
God calling yet! shall I not hear?
Earth's pleasures shall I still hold dear?
Shall life's swift passing years all fly,
And still my soul in slumber lie?

c
Cal1- - ing yet, oh, hear Him!
Call - - ing yet, oh, hear Him!
God is calling yet; oh, hear Him calling, calling!
Call - - ing yet, oh, hear Him!
Call - - ing yet, oh, hear Him!
God is calling yet; oh, hear Him calling yet!

God calling yet! shall I not rise?
Can I His loving voice despise,
And basely His kind care repay?
He calls me still; can I delay?

God calling yet! and shall He knock,
And I my heart the closer lock?
He still is waiting to receive;
And shall I dare His Spirit grieve?

God calling yet! and shall I give
No heed, but still in bondage live?
I wait; but He does not forsake:
He calls me still: my heart, awake!

God calling yet! I cannot stay;
My heart I yield without delay:
Vain world, farewell I from thee I part;
The voice of God has reached my heart.


340
To-day the Saviour calls: Ye wanderers, come;

To-day the Saviour calls:
Ye wanderers, come;
Oh, ye benighted souls,
Why longer roam?

To-day the Saviour calls:
Oh, listen now!
Within these sacred walls
To Jesus bow.

To-day the Saviour calls:
For refuge fly;
The storm of justice falls,
And death is nigh.

The Spirit calls to-day:
Yield to His power;
Oh, grieve Him not away!
"Tis mercy's hour.


341
While we pray, and while we plead,

While we pray, and while we plead,
While you see your soul's deep need.
While ycur Father calls you home,
Will you not, my brother, come?

c
Why not now? . . why not now?
Why not come to Jesus now?
Why not now? . . why not now? . .
Why not come to Jesus now?

You have wandered far away,
Do not risk another day;
Do not turn from God your face,
But to-day accept His grace.

In the world you've failed to find
Aught of peace for troubled mind;
Come to Christ, on Him believe,
Peace and j'oy you shall receive.

Come to Christ, confession make;
Come to Christ and pardon take;
Trust in Him from day to day,
He will keep you all the way.


342
Out of Christ, and yet so near,

Out of Christ, and yet so near,
That Thy heart His voice can hear,
Pleading still—O" Come to Me!
I have given My life for thee."

c
Out of Christ, a slave to sin—
Rise, and let the Saviour in!
If thou bid Him longer wait,
Soon for thee 'twill be too late.

Out of Christ, a wanderer yet—
What if now thy sun should set?
And in darkness leave thy soul
To the tempter's dread control.

Yield to Him thy broken heart,
He will take thee as thou art;
Now His offered grace receive,
And no more the Spirit grieve.


343
There are angels hovering round,

There are angels hovering round,
There are angels hovering round,
There are angels, angels hovering round.

To carry the tidings home, etc.

To the new Jerusalem.

Poor sinners are coming home.

And Jesus bids them come.

And children too may come.

All heaven is full of joy.

For Jesus loves to save.

Come, children, trust Him now.


344
Hark! there comes a whisper,

Hark! there comes a whisper,
Stealing on thine ear;
Tis the Saviour calling,
Soft, soft and clear."

c
Give thy heart to Me, . .
Once I died for thee"; . .
Hark! hark! thy Saviour calls:
Come, sinner, come!

With that voice so gentle,
Dost thou hear Him say?—
"Tell Me all thy sorrows;
Come, come away!"

Wouldst thou find a Refuge
For thy soul oppressed?
Jesus kindly answers, "
I am thy rest."

At the cross of Jesus
Let thy burden fall;
While He gently whispers,
"I'll bear it all."


345
Sinner, how thy heart is troubled!

Sinner, how thy heart is troubled!
God is coming very near;
Do not hide thy deep emotion,
Do not check that failing tear.

c
Oh, be saved, His grace is free!
Oh, be saved, He died for thee!
Oh, be saved, He died for thee!

Jesus now is bending o'er thee,
Jesus lowly, meek, and mild:
To the Friend who died to save thee,
Wilt thou not be reconciled?

Art thou waiting till the morrow?
Thou may'st never see its light;
Come at once! accept His mercy:
He is waiting—come to-night!

With a lowly, contrite spirit,
Kneeling at the Saviour's feet,
Thou canst feel, this very moment,
Pardon—precious, pure, and sweet!

Let the angels bear the tidings
Upward to the courts of heaven!
Let them sing, with holy rapture,
O'er another soul forgiven!


346
Not far, not far from the Kingdom,

Not far, not far from the Kingdom,
Yet in the shadow of sin;
How many are coming and going!—
How few there are entering in!

C
How few there are entering in!
How few there are entering in!
How many are coming and going!-—
How few there are entering in!

Not far, not far from the Kingdom,
Where voices whisper and wait;
Too timid to enter in boldly,
So linger still outside the gate.

Away in the dark and the danger
Far out in the night and the cold;
There Jesus is waiting to lead you
So tenderly into His fold.

Not far, not far from the Kingdom,
'Tis only a little space;
But oh, you may still be for ever
Shut out from yon heavenly place!


347
Oh come, sinner, come! 'tis mercy's call;

Oh come, sinner, come! 'tis mercy's call;
Here at Jesus' feet!
Oh come, and, repenting, lay thy all
Down at Jesus' feet!

c
Oh, lay it down! lav it down!
Lay thy weary burden down;
Oh, lay it down, lay it down,
Down at Jesus' feet!

Oh come, and, believing, seek thy rest
Here at Jesus' feet!
Thy heart, with its heavy weight oppressed
Lay at Jesus* feet!

Oh come, where thy faith can make thee whole,
Here at Jesus' feet!
Oh come, and thy weary, troubled soul
Lay at Jesus' feet!

Oh come! bless the Lord, there's
room for thee,
Here at Jesus' feet!
Thy burden of guilt, whate'er it be,
Lay at Jesus' feet!


348
Why waitest thou, O burdened soul,

Why waitest thou, O burdened soul,
When Jesus now will make thee whole?
Give up thy all to His control—
The Life, the Truth, the Way.

c
He is calling thee, gently calling thee;
He is calling thee, gently calling thee:
Oh, come and give Him now thy heart—
He is calling thee to-day.

Why waitest thou? why not believe?
His offered grace with joy receive;
How can you still the Spirit grieve?
Thou hast no time to stay.

Why waitest thou? the days are few,
And there is work for thee to do;
Forsake the wrong, the right pursue;
Arise! no more delay.


349
Come, oh come, with thy broken heart,

Come, oh come, with thy broken heart,
Weary and worn with care;
Come and kneel at the open door,
Jesus is waiting there:
Waiting to heal thy wounded soul,
Waiting to give thee rest:
Why wilt thou walk where shadows fall?
Come to His loving breast!

Firmly cling to the blessed cross,
There shall thy refuge be;
Wash thee now in the crimson fount,
Flowing so pure for thee:
List to the gentle, warning voice!
List to the earnest call!
Leave at the cross thy burden now:
Jesus will bear it all.

Come and taste of the precious feast,
Feast of eternal love;
Think of joys that for ever bloom,
Bright in the life above:
Come with a trusting heart to God,
Come and be saved by grace;
Come, for He longs to clasp thee now
Close in His dear embrace.


350
I have a Saviour, He's pleading in glory,

I have a Saviour, He's pleading in glory,
A dear loving Saviour, though earth-friends be few;
And now He is watching in tenderness o'er me:
And oh, that my Saviour were your Saviour too!

c
For you I am praying, for you I am praying,
For you I am praying, I'm praying for you.

I have a Father: to me He has given
A hope for eternity, blessed and true:
And soon He will call me to meet Him in heaven,
But oh, may He lead you to go with me too!

I have a robe: 'tis resplendent in whiteness,
Awaiting in glory my wondering view;
Oh, when I receive it all shining in brightness,
Dear friend, could I see you receiving one too!

I have a peace: it is calm as a river—
A peace that the friends of this world never knew;
My Saviour alone is its Author and Giver,
And oh, could I know it was given to you!

When Jesus has found you, tell others the story,
That my loving Saviour is your Saviour too;
Then pray that your Saviour may bring them to glory,
And prayer will be answered, 'twas answered for you!


351
Why do you wait, dear brother?

Why do you wait, dear brother?
Oh, why do you tarry so long?
Your Saviour is waiting to give you
A place in His sanctified throng.

c
Why not?—Why not?—
Why not come to Him now?

What do you hope, dear brother,
To gain by a further delay?
There's no one to save you but Jesus;
There's no other way but His way.

Do you not feel, dear brother,
His Spirit now striving within?
Oh, why not accept His salvation,
And throw off thy burden of sin?

Why do you wait, dear brother?
The harvest is passing away;
Your Saviour is longing to bless you:
There's danger and death in delay.


352
Come with thy sins to the fountain,

Come with thy sins to the fountain,
Come with thy burden of grief;
Bury them deep in its waters—
There thou wilt find a relief.

c
Haste thou away!—why wilt thou stay?
Risk not thy soul on a moment's delay;
Jesus is waiting to save thee,
Mercy is pleading to-day!

Come as thou art to the fountain—
Jesus is waiting for thee;
What though thy sins be like crimson?—
White as the snow they shall be!

These are the words of the Saviour:
They who repent and believe,
They who are willing to trust Him,
Life at His hands shall receive.

Come and be healed at the fountain—
List to the peace-speaking voice;
Over a sinner returning,
Now let the angels rejoice!


353
Oh, the precious gospel story,

Oh, the precious gospel story,
How it tells of love to all!
How the Saviour in compassion
Died to save us from the Fall;
How He came to seek the lost ones,
And to bring them to His fold:
Let us hasten to proclaim it,
For the story must be told.

c
The story musi be told, ...
The story must be told;
That Jesus died for sinners lost,
The story must be told.

Oh, the blessed gospel story
Of His meek and lowly birth,
And the welcome of the angels
When they sang good-will to earth;—
Of the cross on which He suffered,
As by prophets seen of old,—
Of His death and resurrection,
Let the story now be told.

Oh, the wondrous gospel story!
There is life in every word;
There is hope and consolation
Where the message sweet is heard;
Let us tell it to the weary,
And its beauties all unfold;
Tis the only guide to heaven,
And the story must be told.

Freely, freely, freely;
Treasures unfailing will there be given
Freely to those that love Him.

Kingdoms of glory, and crowns of light,
Freely to those that love Him.

Freely, freely, freely;
Pleasures that never shall pass away,
Freely to those that love Him.

Everlasting life shall have."

To a feast prepared for all;
Do not slight the invitation,
Nor reject the gracious call."
I am the Bread of life;
Eat of Me, thou hungry soul;
Though your sins be red as crimson,
They shall be as white as wool."'

The Gospel bells give warning,
As they sound from day to day,
Of the fate which doth await them
Who for ever will delay."
Escape thou for thy life,
Tarry not in all the plain;
Nor behind thee look—oh, never.
Lest thou be consumed in pain."

The Gospel bells are joyful,
As they echo far and wide,
Bearing notes of perfect pardon,
Through a Saviour crucified.
"Good tidings of great joy
To all people do I bring;
Unto you is born a Saviour,
Which is Christ the Lord" and King.

All who believe on Him, the Lord hath said,
"Have everlasting life."

Though poor and needy, I can trust my Lord;
Though weak and sinful, I believe His word;
Oh, glad mer sage! every child of God

To all the world is opened wide;
Where all may come, by sin opprest,
And find in Him sweet peace and rest.

Behold Him now exalted high
Above the bright and starry sky;
Yet through His Word He calleth still,
"Come unto Me, "whoever will.

Behold in Him the Living Way,
That onward leads to endless day;
Where, saved by grace, the ransomed throng
Lift up the everlasting song.

I will in no wise, I will in no wise,
I will in no wise cast out."

That call has no sweet charm for thee?
Wilt thou not turn and give Him heed?
Wilt thou not think while He doth plead?

Thy Saviour calls! He knows thy sin;
But trust Him now, He'll enter in:
And He thy heart will purify,
And every needed grace supply.

Hark, my soul! it is the Lord;
'Tis thy Saviour, hear His word;
Jesus speaks, and speaks to thee—
"Say, poor sinner, lov'st thou Me?"

"I delivered thee when bound,
And, when bleeding, healed thy wound;
Sought thee wandering, set thee right;
Turned thy darkness into light.

"Can a woman's tender care
Cease towards the child she bare?
Yes! she may forgetful be;
Yet will I remember thee.

"Mine is an unchanging love,
Higher than the heights above;
Deeper than the depths beneath,
Free and faithful, strong as death.

"Thou shalt see My glory soon,
When the work of grace is done;
Partner of My throne shalt be;—
Say, poor sinner, lov'st thou Me?"

Lord, it is my chief complaint
That my love is weak and faint;
Yet, I love Thee and adore;
Oh for grace to love Thee more.

A ruler once came to Jesus by night,

A ruler once came to Jesus by night,
To ask Him the way of salvation and light;
The Master made answer in words true and plain,
"Ye must be born again!"

"Ye must be born again!" .."
Ye must be born again!" ...
I verily, verily say unto thee—
"Ye must be born again!" ...

Ye children of men, attend to the word
So solemnly uttered by Jesus, the Lord;
And let not this message to you be in vain:
"Ye must be born again!"

O ye who would enter this glorious rest,
And sing with the ransomed the song of the blest—
The life everlasting if ye would obtain,
"Ye must be born again!"

A dear one in heaven thy heart yearns to see,
At the beautiful gate may be watching for thee;
Then list to the note of this solemn refrain.
"Ye must be born again!"


367
'Tis a true and faithful saying,

'Tis a true and faithful saying,
Jesus died for sinful men;
Though we've told the story often,
We must tell it o'er again.

c
Oh, glad and glorious Gospel!
With joy we now proclaim . .
A full and free salvation.
Through faith in Jesus' name!

He has made a full atonement,
Now His saving work is done;
He has satisfied the Father,
Who accepts us in His Son.

Still upon His hands the nail-prints,
And the scars upon His brow;
Our Redeemer, Lord, and Saviour,
In the glory standeth now.

But remember, this same Jesus
In the clouds will come again;
And with Him His blood-bought people
Evermore shall live and reign.


368
We never grow weary of telling

We never grow weary of telling
The story of Jesus our King;
Who left the bright throne of His glory,
And came His great treasures to bring.

c
Oh, wonderful gift of the Gospel,
That each in our hearts maj receive!
It offers to all free salvation,
And happy are they that believe.

We never grow weary of telling
His love to the poor and oppressed;
And still He is tenderly calling,
"Come hither, ye weary, and rest!"

We never grow weary of telling
Of yonder bright mansions above;
Where we shall behold our Redeemer,
And dwell in the smile of His love.

Your broken cisterns first;
Then come, partake: one draught will slake
Your soul's consuming thirst.

Yea, "whosoever will" may come-
Your longings Christ can fill;
The stream is free to you and me,
And whosoever will.

Are you coming Home, ye wanderers,

Are you coming Home, ye wanderers,

And dare to trust Him quite!—

Are you coming Home to-night?

There is a gate that stands ajar,

There is a gate that stands ajar,
And through its portals gleaming
A radiance from the cross afar,
The Saviour's love revealing.

c
Oh, depth of mercy! can it be
That gate was left ajar for me,
For me, . . for me? . .
Was left ajar for me?

That gate ajar stands free for all
Who seek through it salvation;
The rich and poor, the great and small
Of every tribe and nation.

Press onward, then, though foes may frown,
While mercy's gate is open;
Accept the cross, and win the crown,
Love's everlasting token.

Beyond the river's brink we'll lay
The cross that here is given,
And bear the crown of life away,
And love Him more in heaven.


373
Back from the weary wandering Into the narrow way;

Back from the weary wandering
Into the narrow way;
Jesus is tenderly calling,
Calling the sheep that stray.

c
Still, still Jesus is calling:
Hear, oh hear Him say:
"Weary, heavy laden,
Come, come to-day!"

Out of the dreary desert
Into the pastures green,
Out of the land of darkness
Into the light serene.

Why should we longer tarry,
Why should we longer roam
Far from the place of refuge,
Far from the sheltering home?

Come, for the hours are waning;
Come from the mountains cold;
Come from the storm and tempest
Into the Shepherd's fold!


374

And I will give you rest."

Of pardon, grace, and peace;
Of joy that hath no ending;
Of love which cannot cease.

"Come unto Me, ye wanderers,
And I will give you light."
Oh, loving voice of Jesus,
Which comes to cheer the night!
Our hearts were filled with sadness,
And we had lost our way;
But. He has brought us gladness,
And songs at break of day.

"Come unto Me, ye fainting,
And I will give you life."
Oh, cheering voice of Jesus,
Which comes to aid our strife:
The foe is stem and eager,
The fight is fierce and long,
But He has made us mighty,
And stronger than the strong.

"And whosoever cometh
I will not cast him out."
Oh, welcome voice of Jesus,
Which drives away our doubt:
Which calls us—very sinners,
Unworthy though we be
Of love so free and boundless—
To come, dear Lord, to Thee!

Bruised and ruined by the Fall;

On the ground your Maker lies!
On the bloody tree behold Him,

Pleads the merit of His blood;
Venture on Him. venture wholly,
Let no other trust intrude;
None but Jesus
Can do helpless sinners good.

With the word, the sword of the Spirit,
To meet the advancing foe.

And the all-prevailing name
Of Christ, the world's Redeemer,
His Gospel to proclaim.

Sin-stained wanderers from the fold;
Peace and pardon freely offer;
Can you weigh their worth with gold?
"Call them in"—the weak, the weary,
Laden with the doom of sin;
Bid them come and rest in Jesus;
He is waiting—" Call them in."

Bid the stranger to the feast;

From the highest to the least:
Forth the Father runs to meet them,
He hath all their sorrows seen;
Robe, and ring, and royal sandals,
Wait the lost ones—" Call them in."

Tarrying far away . . . away;

Bring the halt and blind to Jesus;
He will heal them—"Call them in."

Cowering 'neath the brand of shame;

See! the shadows lengthen round us,
Soon the day-dawn will begin;
Can you leave them lost and lonely?
Christ is coming—" Call them in."

And on to glory go,
To dwell in that celestial land
Where joys immortal flow.

Our life is like a stormy sea

Our life is like a stormy sea
Swept by the gales of sin and grief;
While on the windward and the lee
Hang heavy clouds of unbelief.
But o'er the deep a call we hear,
Like harbour bell's inviting voice;
It tells the lost that hope is near.
And bids the trembling soul rejoice.

c
"This way, this way, O heart opprest,
So long by storm and tempest driven;
This way, this way—lo! here is rest,"
Rings out the harbour bell of heaven.

Oh, let us now the call obey,
And steer our bark for yonder shore;
Where still that voice directs the way,
In pleading tones for evermore.
A thousand life-wrecks strew the sea;
They're going down at every swell:
"Come unto me! Come unto me!"
Rings out th' assuring harbour bell.

O tempted one, look up, be strong!
The promise of the Lord is sure,
That they shall sing the victor's song,
Who faithful to the end endure.
God's Holy Spirit comes to thee,
Of His abiding love to tell;
To blissful port, o'er stormy sea,
Calls heaven's inviting harbour bell.

Come, gracious Lord, and in Thy love
Conduct us o'er life's stormy wave;
Oh, guide us to the home above,
The blissful home beyond the grave;
There, safe from rock, and storm, and flood,
Our song of praise shall never cease,
To Him who bought us with His blood,
And brought us to the port of peace.


396
Jesus is tenderly calling thee home—

Jesus is tenderly calling thee home—
Calling to-day, calling to-day!
Why from the sunshine of love wilt
thou roam,
Farther and farther away?

c
Calling to-day! calling to-day! ...
Jesus is calling,
is tenderly calling to-day!

Jesus is calling the weary to rest—
Calling to-day, calling to-day!
Bring Him thy burden, and thou

He will not turn thee away.

Jesus is waiting, oh, come to Him now—
Waiting to-day, waiting to-day!
Come with thy sins, at His feet lowly bow;
Come, and no longer delay!

Jesus is pleading: oh, list to His voice—
Hear Him to-day, hear Him to-day!
They who believe on His name shall rejoice;
Quickly arise and away!

Look from your prayers and tears

"Look unto Me, and be ye saved!"

Look, and your sins are gone!

Not saved are we by trying, From self can come no aid;

Not saved are we by trying,
From self can come no aid;
'Tis on the Blood relying,
Once for our ransom paid.
Tis looking unto Jesus,
The holy One and just;
'Tis His great work that saves us -
It is not Try, but Trust!

c
It is not Try, but Trust!
It is not Try, but Trust!
'Tis His great work that saves us:
It is not Try, but Trust!

Twas vain for Israel bitten
By serpents, on their way,
To look to their own doing,
That awful plague to stay;
The only means for healing,
When humbled in the dust,
Was of the Lord's revealing—
It was not Try, but Trust!

No deeds of ours are needed
To make Christ's merit more;
No frames of mind, or feelings,
Can add to His great store;
'Tis simply to receive Him,
The holy One and just;
'Tis only to believe Him—
It is not Try, but Trust!


399
Come to the Saviour now! He gently calleth thee;

Come to the Saviour now!

In true repentance bow,
Before Him bend the knee!

Salvation, peace, and love,
True joy on earth below,
A home in heaven above.
Come, come, come.

Come to the Saviour now!
Gaze on that cleansing tide—
Water and blood that flow
Forth from His wounded side.
Hark to the suffering One:
"'Tis finished!" now He cries;
Redemption's work is done,
Then bows His head and dies.
Come, come, come.

Come to the Saviour now!
He suffered all for thee;
And in His merits thou
Hast an unfailing plea:
No vain excuses frame,
For feelings do not stay;
None who to Jesus came
Were ever sent away.
Come, come, come.

Come to the Saviour now!
Ye who have wandered far,
Renew your solemn vow,
For His by right you are.
Come, like poor wandering sheep
Returning to His fold—
His arm will safely keep,
His love will ne'er grow cold.
Come, come, come.

Come to the Saviour, all!
Whate'er your burdens be;
Hear now His loving call—
"Cast all your care on Me."
Come, and for every grief
In Jesus you will find
A sure and safe relief,
A loving Friend and kind.
Come, come, come.

Art thou weary? art thou languid?

Art thou weary? art thou languid?
Art thou sore distrest?
"Come to Me, "saith One;"and coming,
Be at rest!"

Hath He marks to lead me to Him,
If He be my guide?
"In His feet and hands are wound prints,
And His side."

Is there diadem as Monarch
That His brow adorns?
"Yea, a crown, in very surety,
But of thorns."

If I find Him, if I follow,
What His guerdon here?
'* Many a sorrow, many a labour,
Many a tear."

If I still hold closely to Him,
What hath He at last?
"Sorrow vanquished, labour ended,
Jordan passed."

If I ask Him to receive me,
Will He say me nay?
"Not till earth, and not till heaven,
Pass away."

Finding, following, keeping, struggling,
Is He sure to bless?
"Saints, Apostles, Prophets, Martyrs,
Answer—Yes!"


402
Press onward, press onward, and, trusting the Lord,

Remember the promise proclaimed in His Word;

Of all who confess Him: believe and obey!

The light of His mercy shines bright on the way
Of all who confess Him: believe and obey.

The rest of the faithful, abiding and sure;
The gift of salvation is offered to-day
To all who confess Him: believe and obey!

Press onward, press onward, your courage renew;
The prize is before you, the crown is in view;
His love is so boundless, He'll never say Nay
To those who confess Him: believe and obey!


403
Over the thorn and thistle, Along the stony way,

Over the thorn and thistle,
Along the stony way,
From the Shepherd's care to the desert bare,
There wandered a sheep one day;
And a voice fell sadly from far away:
"My sheep, how long wilt thou love to stray?"

Over the thorn and thistle,
Along the stony way, [
With feet that bled, the Shepherd sped
To where the wanderer lay;
He had heard it crying from far away:
"Lord, bring me home to Thy flock, I pray!"

"Over the thorn and thistle,
Along the stony way,
I have sought for thee, now trust to Me,
I'll bear thee home to-day.
The wolfand lion flee far away
When on My shoulder My sheep I lay."

Instead of the thorn and thistle,
The myrtle bedecks the way
Where the Shepherd feeds and gently leads
The sheep He found that day;
And He leadeth others from far away
To rest in fields of a cloudless day.


404
Weary wanderer, stop and listen,

Weary wanderer, stop and listen,
Happy news we bring to thee;
Jesus has prepared a banquet;
Come, and welcome thou shalt be.

c
Make no longer vain excuses,
Jesus calls, and calls thee now;
Come, for everything is ready:
Weary soul, why waitest thou?

Are thy sins a heavy burden?
Come to God, confess them now;
He is willing to forgive thee;
Ask, receive, why waitest thou?

On the loving arm of Jesus
Wouldst thou lean, and trust Him now?
Let Him cleanse thee at the fountain;
Come at once! why waitest thou?

See the beauteous wedding garment;
In His hands He holds it now:
Haste, oh haste, thee to the banquet;
Enter in! why waitest thou?


405
Come, for all things are ready! 'Tis a banquet of love;

Come, for all things are ready! 'Tis a banquet of love;
Here's a free invitation from the Master above:
It is written in crimson, drawn from Calvary's flood,
From the wonderful fountain of the soul-cleansing blood.

c
Oh, what fulness in Jesus! Oh, what gladness to know,
Though our sins be as scarlet, He'll make them as snow.

Come, for all things are ready!
Heaven's bounty is spread;
Take the cup of salvation, take the life-giving bread:
Come, though poor and unworthy;
come, though sinful and weak;
'Tis the hungry and thirsty whom the Master doth seek.

Come, for all things are ready! here's a robe, snowy white,
Fairer far than the raiment of the angels of light:
For the beauty of Jesus will thy covering be;
Only ask for this garment, 'twill be given to thee.'


406
Though your sins are manifold—

Though your sins are manifold—
Jesus will not cast you out!

Freely gave His only Son;
Come, whate'er you may have done-
Jesus will not cast you out!

Though you've spurned Him day by day—
Jesus will not cast you out!

Jesus will not cast you out!

Grace is freely offered now—
Jesus will not cast you out!
At the cross, O wanderer, bow—

Come, He bids you enter in!
Come, and life eternal win!
Jesus will not cast you out!


407
Come, thou weary! Jesus calls thee

Come, thou weary! Jesus calls thee
To His wounded side;
"Come to Me, "saith He, "and ever
Safe abide."

"Seeking Jesus"? Jesus seeks thee—
Wants thee as thou art;
He is knocking, ever knocking
At thy heart.

If thou let Him, He will save thee—
Make thee all His own;
Guide thee; keep thee; take thee,dying.
To His throne.

Wilt thou still refuse His offer?
Wilt thou say Him nay?
Wilt thou let Him, grieved, rejected,
Go away?

Dost thou feel thy life is weary?
Is thy soul distrest?
Take His offer, wait no longer:
Be at rest!


408
Come to Jesus! come away!

Come to Jesus! come away!
Forsake thy sins—oh, why delay?
His arms are open night and day;
He waits to welcome thee!

Come to Jesus! all is free;
Hark! how He calls, "Come unto Me!
I cast out none, I'll pardon thee."
Oh, thou shalt welcome be!

Come to Jesus! cling to Him;
He'll keep thee far from paths of sin;
Thou shalt at last the victory win,
And He will welcome thee.

Come to Jesus! do not stand:
The Father draws—'tis His command;
And none shall pluck thee from His hand,
No—that can never be!

Come to Jesus! —Lord, I come!
Weary of sin, no more I'd roam,
But with my Saviour be at home;
I know He'll welcome me!


409
Look away to Jesus, soul by woe oppressed;

Look away to Jesus, soul by woe oppressed;
Twas for thee He suffered, come to Him and rest.
All thy griefs He carried, all thy sins He bore;
Look away to Jesus; trust Him ever more.

Look away to Jesus, soldier in the fight;
When the battle thickens, keep thine armour bright;
Though thy foes be many, though thy strength be small,
Look away to Jesus; He will conquer all.

Look away to Jesus, when the skies are fair:
Calm seas have their dangers; mariner, beware!
Earthly joys are fleeting, going as they came;
Look away to Jesus; evermore the same.

Look away to Jesus, 'mid the toil and heat;
Soon will come the resting at the Master's feet;
For the guests are bidden, and the feast is spread;
Look away to Jesus, in His footsteps tread.

When, amid the music of the endless feast,
Saints will sing His praises,
thine shall not be least;
Then, amid the glories of the crystal sea,
Look away to Jesus, through eternity.


410
Oh, come to the Saviour, believe in His name,

Oh, come to the Saviour, believe in His name,
And ask Him your heart to renew:
He waits to be gracious, oh, turn not away,
For now there is pardon for you.

Yes, there is pardon for you, ...
Yes, there is pardon for you; ...
For Jesus has died to redeem you,
And offers full uardon to you.

The way of transgression that leads unto death,
Oh, why will you longer pursue?
How can you reject the sweet message of love,
That offers full pardon to you?

Be warned of your danger, escape to the cross;
Your only salvation is there:
Believe, and that moment the Spirit of grace
Will answer your penitent prayer.


411

Look to Jesus now and live;
'Tis recorded in His Word, Hallelujah!
It is only that you" look and live!"

I've a message full of love, Hallelujah!
A message, O my friend, for you;
Tis a message from above, Hallelujah!
Jesus said it—and I know 'tis true!

Life is offered unto thee, Hallelujah!
Eternal life thy soul shall have,
If you'll only look to Him, Hallelujah!
Look to Jesus, who alone can save.


412
This loving Saviour stands patiently;

This loving Saviour stands patiently;
Though oft rejected, calls again for thee.

c
Calling now for thee, prodigal,
Calling now for thee:
Thou hast wandered far away,
But He's calling now for thee.

Oh, boundless mercy, free, free to all!
Stay, child of error, heed the tender call.
Though all unworthy, come now, come home;
Say while He's waiting, "Jesus, Lord, I come."


413

Tenderly He calleth you!

c

Haste while He lingers; pardon now implore!
Still He is waiting, grieve His love no more:
Tenderly He calleth you.

Blest words of comfort, gently now they fall,
Jesus is the Life, the Truth, the Way;
Come to the fountain, there is room for all,
Jesus bids you come to-day.

Do not slight the Saviour's offered grace;
Gladly receive Him, let Him not depart—
Happy they who seek His face!

Calling for you and for me;
Patiently Jesus is waiting and watching—
Watching for you and for me!

c
"Come home! ... come home! ...
Ye who are weary—come home!"
Earnestly, tenderly Jesus is calling—
Calling, O sinner, "come home!"

Why should we tarry when Jesus is pleading—
Pleading for you and for me?
Why should we linger and heed not His mercies—
Mercies for you and for me?

Time is now fleeting, the moments are passing—
Passing from you and from me;
Shadows are gathering, deathbeds are coming—
Coming for you and for me!

Oh for the wonderful love He has promised—
Promised for you and for me!
Though we have sinned, He has mercy and pardon—
Pardon for you and for me!


415
Ho! every one that is thirsty in spirit,

Ho! every one that is thirsty in spirit,
Ho! every one that is weary and sad;
Come to the fountain, there's fulness in Jesus,
All that you're longing for: come and be glad!

c
"I will pour water on him that is thirsty,
I will pour floods upon the dry ground:
Open your hearts for the gifts I am bringing;
While ye are seeking Me, I will be found."

Child of the world, are you tired of your bondage?
Weary of earth-joys, so false, so untrue?
Thirsting for God and His fulness of blessing?—
List to the promise—a message for you!

Child of the Kingdom, be filled with the Spirit!
Nothing but fulness thy longing can meet;
'Tis the enduement for life and for service;
Thine is the promise, so certain, so sweet.


416
From the cross uplifted high,Where the Saviour

From the cross uplifted high,
Where the Saviour deigns to die,
What melodious sounds we hear,
Bursting on the ravished ear!
"Love's redeeming work is done—
Come and welcome! sinner, come!

"Spread for thee, the festal board
See with richest bounty stored;
To thy Father's bosom pressed,
Thou shalt be a child confessed,
Never from His house to roam;
Come and welcome! sinner, come!
3" Soon the days of life shall end—
Lo, I come—your Saviour, Friend!
Safe your spirit to convey
To the realms of endless day,
Up to My eternal home—
Come and welcome! sinner, come!"


417
The whole world was lost in the darkness of sin,

The whole world was lost in the darkness of sin,
The Light of the world is Jesus!
Like sunshine at noonday His glory shone in,
The Light of the world is Jesus!

c
Come to the Light, 'tis shining for thee;
Sweetly the Light has dawned upon me;
Once I was blind, but now I can see:
The Light of the world is Jesus!

No darkness have we who in Jesus abide,
The Light of the world is Jesus!
We walk in the Light when we follew our Guide,
The Light of the world is Jesus!

Ye dwellers in darkness, with sinblinded eyes,
The Light of the world is Jesus!
Go, wash at His bidding, and light will arise,
The Light of the world is Jesus!

No need of the sunlight in heaven, we're told,
The Light of that world is Jesus!
The Lamb is the Light in the City of Gold,
The Light of that world is Jesus!


418
Out on the mountain, sad and forsaken,

Out on the mountain, sad and forsaken,
Lost in its mazes, no light canst thou see;
Yet in His mercy, full of compassion,
Lo! the Good Shepherd is calling to thee!

c
Calling to thee, calling to thee;
Jesus is calling, "Come unto Me!"
Calling to thee, calling to thee,
Hear the Good Shepherd calling to thee!

Far on the mountain, why wilt thou wander?
Darker and darker thy pathway will be;
Turn from thy roaming, fly from its dangers,
While the Good Shepherd is calling to thee!

Flee from thy bondage, Jesus will help thee,
Only believe Him, and thou shalt be free;
Wonderful mercy, boundless compassion:
Still the Good Shepherd is calling to thee!


419
Oh, hear the joyful message,'Tis sounding far

Oh, hear the joyful message,
'Tis sounding far and wide:
Good news of full salvation,
Through Him, the Crucified;
God's Word is truth eternal;
Its promise all may claim,
Who look by faith to Jesus,
And call upon His name.

c
"Whosoever calleth, whosoever calleth,
Whosoever calleth on His name shall be saved!
Whosoever calleth, whosoever calleth,
Whosoever calleth on the Lord shall be saved"

Ye souls that long in darkness
The path of sin have trod,
Behold the light of mercy!
Behold the Lamb of God!
With all your heart believe Him,
And now the promise claim—
That none shall ever perish
Who call upon His name.

Ye weary, heavy-laden,
Oppressed with toil and care:
He waits to bid you welcome,
And all your burdens bear;
A precious gift He offers,
A gift that all may claim,
Who look to Him believing,
And call upon His name.


420
Just as thou art, without one trace

Just as thou art, without one trace
Of love, or joy, or inward grace,
Or meetness for the heavenly place,
O guilty sinner, come!

Burdened with guilt, wouldst thou be blest?
Trust not the world, it gives no rest;
Christ brings relief to hearts opprest;
O weary sinner, come!

Come, leave thy burden at the cross,
Count all thy gains but empty dross;
His grace repays all earthly loss:
O needy sinner, come!

Come, hither bring thy boding fears,
Thy aching heart, thy burning tears;
'Tis Mercy's voice salutes thine ears:
O trembling sinner, come!

"The Spirit and the Bride say, Come!"
Rejoicing saints re-echo, "Come!"
Who faints, who thirsts, who will, may come:
The Saviour bids thee come!


421
Wouldst thou, O weary soul, be blest?

Wouldst thou, O weary soul, be blest?
In Christ the Lord thy Saviour see;
His grace alone can give thee rest,
And lo! He calleth, "Come to Me!"

c
Oh, come to Me! ... Oh, come to Me! ...
The Saviour calleth, "Come to Me! ...
Ye heavy la den, come to Me, ...
And I will give you rest."

He does not wait for greater worth,
Or more of holiness in thee;
He brings good news to all the earth,
And still He calleth, "Come to Me!"

Hast thou not sinned ten thousand times?
His pardoning grace will set thee free;
Count unbelief the worst of crimes,
And trust thy Saviour's" Come to Me!"

Eternal life is in His Word,
He asks thee now His child to be;
No sweeter sound was ever heard
Than His most gracious" Come to Me!"

Be this thine answer now, and here:
"Since Thou hast kindly called for me,
Thy tender love dispels my fear;
I come. I come O Lord, to Thee!


422
Knocking, knocking, who is there?

Knocking, knocking, who is there?
Waiting, waiting, oh, how fair!
Tis a Pilgrim, strange and kingly,
Never such was seen before;
Ah, my soul, for such a wonder,
Wilt thou not undo the door?

Knocking, knocking! still He's there:
Waiting, waiting, wondrous fair:
But the door is hard to open,
For the weeds and ivy-vine,
With their dark and clinging tendrils,
Ever round the hinges twine.

Knocking, knocking — what, still there?
Waiting, waiting, grand and fair!
Yes, the pierced hand still knocketh,
And beneath the crowned hair
Beam the patient eyes, so tender,
Of thy Saviour waiting there.


423
Why perish with cold and with hunger?

Why perish with cold and with hunger?
There's plenty for all and to spare
In the beautiful home of thy Father,
And a welcome awaiting thee there.

c
Come! come! wanderer, come!
There's plenty for thee in thy Father's home;
Come! come! wanderer, come!
There's welcome and love in thy Father's home.

Come, wanderer, and say to thy Father,
"I've sinned against heaven and Thee;
Not worthy a place with Thy children,
Thy servant I gladly would be."

Thy Father is waiting to greet thee,
And watching for thee to return;
His heart is so full of compassion:
Oh, prodigal, wilt thou not come?


424
"Come unto Me!" It is the Saviour's voice—

"Come unto Me!" It is the Saviour's voice—
The Lord of life, who bids thy heart rejoice;
O weary heart, with heavy cares opprest,
"Come unto Me, "and I will give you rest.

c
"Come unto Me, ... come unto Me, ...
Come unto Me; and I will give you rest,
I will give you rest, ... I will give you rest!"

Weary with life's long struggle, full of pain,
O doubting soul, thy Saviour calls again;
Thy doubts shall vanish, and thy sorrows cease;
"Come unto Me, "and I will give you peace.

O dying man, with guilt and sin dismayed,
With conscience wakened, of thy God afraid;
'Twixt hopes and fears—oh, end the anxious strife!—
"Come unto Me, "and I will give you life.

Life, rest, and peace, the flowers of deathless bloom,
The Saviour gives us,—not beyond the tomb;
But here and now: on earth some glimpse is given
Of joys which wait us through the gates of heaven.


425
O word, of words the sweetest,

O word, of words the sweetest,
O word, in which there lie
All promise, all fulfilment,
Arid end of mystery!
Lamenting, or rejoicing,
With doubt or terror nigh,
I hear the "Come!" of Jesus,
And to His cross I fly.

c
"Come! ... oh, come to Me!
Come! ... oh, come to Me!"
Weary, heavy-laden,
Come! oh, come to Me!"

O soul! why shouldst thou wander
From such a loving Friend?
Cling closer, closer to Him,
Stay with Him to the end:
Alas! I am so helpless,
So very full of sin,
For I am ever wandering,
And coming back again.

Oh, each time draw me nearer,
That soon the" Come" may be
Naught but a gentle whisper,
To one close, close to Thee;
Then, over sea and mountain,
Far from or near my home,
I'll take Thy hand and follow,
At that sweet whisper, "Come!"


426
Oh, turn ye, oh, turn ye, for why will ye die,

Oh, turn ye, oh, turn ye, for why will ye die,
When God in great mercy is coming so nigh?
Now Jesus invites you, the Spirit says" Come!"
And angels are waiting to welcome you home.

How vain the delusion, that, while you delay,
Your hearts may grow better, your chains melt away!
Come guilty, come wretched, come just as you are,
All helpless and dying, to Jesus repair.

The contrite in heart He will freely receive;
Oh, why will you not the glad message believe?
If sin be your burden, why will ye not come?
Tis you He makes welcome; He bids you come home.


427
Look to the Saviour on Calvary's tree—

Look to the Saviour on Calvary's tree—
See how He suffered for you and me;
Hark while He lovingly calls to thee,
"Look, and thou shalt live!"

c
Look, and thou shalt live!
Look, and thou shalt live!
Look to the cross where He died for thee:
Look, and thou shalt live!

Hast thou a sin-burdened soul to save?
Life everlasting wouldst thou have?
Jesus Himself a ransom gave:
Look, and thou shalt live!

Look to the Saviour who rose from the tomb;
Haste now to Him, while there yet is room;
His shining face will dispel thy gloom:
Look, and thou shalt live!

Jesus on high lives to intercede,
He knows the weary sinner's need:
Surely thy footsteps He will lead:
Look, and thou shalt live!


428
Why do you linger, why do you stay,

Why do you linger, why do you stay,
In the broad road, that most dangerous way—
While right before you, narrow and strait,
Is the bright pathway to heaven's pearly gate?

c
Narrow and strait, ... narrow and strait ...
Is the bright pathway to heaven's pearly gate.

Do you find pleasures lasting and pure
In the gay scenes that the thought-less allure—
While your Redeemer, with love so great,
Points to the way that is narrow and strait?

Come, then, beloved, no longer stay;
Leave the broad highway, oh, leave it to-day!
Make your decision—oh, do not wait!
Take thou the pathway so narrow and strait!


429
"Yet there is room!" The Lamb's

"Yet there is room!" The Lamb's bright hall of song,
With its fair glory, beckons thee along:

c
Room, room, still room!
Oh, enter, enter now!

Day is declining, and the sun is low;
The shadows lengthen, light makes haste to go.

The bridal hall is filling for the feast;
Pass in! pass in! and be the Bride groom's guest:

It fills, it fills, that hall of jubilee!
Make haste, make haste! 'tis not too full for thee!

Yet there is room! still open stands the gate—
The gate of love; it is not yet too late:

Pass in! pass in! That banquet is for thee:
That cup of everlasting love is free;

All heaven is there! all joy! Go in, go in!
The angels beckon thee the prize to win:

Louder and sweeter sounds the loving call:
Come, lingerer, come! enter that festal hall:

Ere night that gate may close, and seal thy doom:
Then the last, low, long cry, "No room, no room!

c
"No room, no room!
Oh, woful cry I—" No room!"


430
Where will you spend Eternity?

Where will you spend Eternity?
This question comes to you and me!
Teil me, what shall your answer be
Where will you spend Eternity?

c
Eternity! Eternity!
Where will you spend Eternity?

Many are choosing Christ to-day,
Turning from all their sins away;
Heaven shall their blessed portion be
Where will you spend Eternity?

Leaving the strait and narrow way,
Going the downward road to-day,
What shall the final ending be—
Where will you spend Eternity?

Turn, and believe this very hour,
Trust in the Saviour's grace and power:
Warning and Entreaty
Then shall your joyous answer be,
Saved through a long Eternity!

c
Eternity! Eternity!
Saved through a long Eternity!


431
Nothing but leaves! The Spirit grieves

Nothing but leaves! The Spirit grieves
O'er years of wasted life;
O'er sins indulged while conscience slept,
O'er vows and promises unkept;
And reaps, from years of strife,
Nothing but leaves! nothing but leaves!

Nothing but leaves! No gathered sheaves
Of life's fair ripening grain:
We sow our seeds; lo, tares and weeds,
Words, idle words, for earnest deeds:
Then reap, with toil and pain,
Nothing but leaves! nothing but leaves!

Nothing but leaves! Sad memory weaves
No veil to hide the past:
And as we trace our weary way,
And count each lost and misspent day,
We sadly find at last—
Nothing but leaves! nothing but leaves!

Ah! who shall thus the Master meet,
And bring but withered leaves?
Ah! who shall at the Saviour's feet,
Before the awful Judgment-seat,
Lay down, for golden sheaves,
Nothing but leaves, nothing but leaves?


432
At the feast of Belshazzar and a thousand

At the feast of Belshazzar and a
thousand of his lords,
While they drank from golden vessels,
as the Book of Truth records:
In the night, as they revelled in the
royal palace hall,
They were seized with consternation
—'twas the Hand upon the wall!

c
Tis the hand of God on the wall! ...
' Tis the hand of God on the wall! ...
Shall the record be—" Found wanting!"
Or shall it be—"Found trusting!"
While that hand is writing on the wall? ...

See the brave captive, Daniel, as he
stood before the throng,
And rebuked the haughty monarch
for his mighty deeds of wrong;
As he read out the writing—'twas the
doom of one and all,
For the kingdom now was finished—
said the Hand upon the wall!

See the faith, zeal, and courage, that
would dare to do the right,
Which the Spirit gave to Daniel—
'twas the secret of his might;
In his home in Judea,
or a captive in the hall,
He understood the writing of
his God upon the wall!

So our deeds are recorded—there's a
Hand that's writing now:
Sinner, give your heart to Jesus—to
His royal mandate bow;
For the day is approaching—it must
come to one and all,
When the sinner's condemnation will
be written on the wall!


433
Time is earnest, passing by;

Time is earnest, passing by;
Death is earnest, drawing nigh;
Sinner, wilt thou trifling be?
Time and death appeal to thee.

Life is earnest; when 'tis o'er.
Thou returnest nevermore;
Soon to meet eternity,
Wilt thou never serious be?

God is earnest, kneel and pray
Ere thy season pass away;
Ere be set His judgment-throne,
Vengeance ready, mercy gone.

Oh, be earnest! death is near;
Thou wilt perish lingering here:
Sleep no longer, rise and flee;
Lo, thy Saviour waits for thee!


434
Oh, list to the watchman crying:

Oh, list to the watchman crying:
Come, come away!
The arrows of death are flying:
Come, come to-day!

c
Come, come away! Come, come away!
Jesus is gently calling: Come, come to-day!

The Spirit of God is pleading:
Come, come away!
The Saviour is interceding:
Come, come to-day!

The mercy of God is calling:
Come, come away!
How sweetly the words are falling
Come, come to-day!

The angels of God entreat you:
Come, come away!
The Father Himself will meet you:
Come, come to-day!


435
Come home, come home! You are weary at heart,

Come home, come home!
You are weary at heart,
For the way has been dark,
And so lonely and wild:
O prodigal child!
Come home; oh, come home!

c
Come . . home! . .
Come, oh, come home! . .

Come home, come home!
For we watch and we wait;
And we stand at the gate,
While the shadows are piled:
O prodigal child!
Come home; oh, come home!

Come home, come home!
From the sorrow and blame,
From the sin and the shame,
And the tempter that smiled:
O prodigal child!
Come home; oh, come home!

Come home, come home!
There is bread and to spare,
And a warm welcome there:
Then, to friends reconciled,
prodigal child!
Come home; oh, come home!


436
Oh, give thy heart to Jesus,Thy weary heart of care;

Oh, give thy heart to Jesus,
Thy weary heart of care;
No friend can love so deeply;
Go, find thy refuge there.

c
Oh, give thy heart to Jesus—
A balm for every care;
Go, hide beneath His shadow;
No storm can reach thee there.

Oh, trust the heart of Jesus,
Breathe all thy sorrows there;
He loves to hear thy pleadings,
Thy humble, contrite prayer.

Go, hide thyself in Jesus;
No foe can harm thee there;
His hand will lift thy burdens,
And all thy sorrows bear.

Go, lean thy heart on Jesus,
Who sees each falling tear,
No friend so true and tender
Can soothe thy every fear.


437
Life at best is very brief,Like the falling of a leaf,

Life at best is very brief,
Like the falling of a leaf,
Like the binding of a sheaf:
Be in time!
Fleeting days are telling fast
That the die will soon be cast,
And the fatal line be passed:
Be in time!

c
Be in time! ... Be in time! ...
While the voice of Jesus calls you,
Be in time! . . .
If in sin you longer wait,
You may find no open gate,
And your cry be just too late:
Be in time!

Fairest flowers soon decay,
Youth and beauty pass away;
Oh, you have not long to stay:
Be in time!
While God's Spirit bids you come,
Sinner, do not longer roam,
Lest you seal your hopeless doom:
Be in time!

Time is gliding swiftly by,
Death and judgment draweth nigh,
To the arms of Jesus fly:
Be in time!
Oh, I pray you count the cost,
Ere the fatal line be crossed,
And your soul in hell be lost:
Be in time!

Sinner, heed the warning voice,
Make the Lord your final choice,
Then all heaven will rejoice:
Be in time!
Come from darkness into light;
Come, let Jesus make you right;
Come, and start for heaven to-night
Be in time!


438
Look not behind thee; O sinner, beware!

Look not behind thee; O sinner, beware!
Haste to the mountain, thy refuge is there;
Trust not the voices that lure thee to stay;
Jesus is calling thee—then why still delay?

c
List to the warning! no longer remain!
Fly from the valley, escape from the plain!
Turn from the voices that lure thee to stay:
Angels are calling thee—then why still delay?

Look not behind thee; O lost one, beware!
Why dost thou linger 'twixt hope and despair?
Danger and darkness encompass thy way:
Jesus is calling thee—then why still delay?

Look not behind thee, the tempter is near;
Speed to the mountain, thy pathway is clear:
Jesus who loves thee is calling to- day:
Come to thy Father's house—oh,why still delay?


439
Where will you spend eternity—

Where will you spend eternity—
Those years that have no end?
Will it be in that better land?
Will it be at God's right hand?
Will it be with the angel band?
The angel band?

c
Eternity, eternity—
Where will you spend eternity?

Where will you spend eternity—
Those years that have no end?
Will it be where the angels sing?
Will it be with the glorious King?
What a sublime and solemn thing!
A solemn thing!

Where will you spend eternity—
Those years that have no end?
Will it be where you are debarred
Ever to know and see the Lord?
Ever to have His great reward?
His great reward?

Where will you spend eternity—
Those years that have no end?
Will it be on the golden shore,
Safe with the friends that have
gone before?
Safe and happy for evermore?
For evermore?


440
A blessing for you—will you take it?

A blessing for you—will you take it?
Choose ye to-day;
A word from the heart—will you speak it?
Choose ye to-day:
Will you believe, or your Saviour neglect?
Will you receive, or His mercy reject?
Pause, ere you answer, oh, pause and reflect—
Choose ye to-day.

A death to be feared—will you fear it?
Choose ye to-day;
A voice that invites—will you hear it?
Choose ye to-day:
Strait is the portal and narrow the way;
Enter, poor soul, and be saved while you may;
Think what may hang on a moment's delay—
Choose ye to-day.

The cross of your Lord—will you bear it?
Choose ye to-day:
There's life in that cross—will you share it?
Choose ye to-day:
Soon will your time of probation be o'er,
Then will the Spirit entreat you no more,
Jesus no longer will stand at the door—
Choose ye to-day.

The bondage of sin—will you break it?
Choose ye to-day:
The Water of Life—will you take it?
Choose ye to-day:
Come to the arms that are open for you,
Hide in the wounds that by faith you may view;
Death ere the morrow your steps may pursue—
Choose ye to-day.


441
In the silent midnight watches,

In the silent midnight watches,
List—thy bosom's door!
How it knocketh, knocketh, knocketh,
Knocketh evermore!
Say not 'tis thy pulse is beating—
'Tis thy heart of sin;
'Tis thy Saviour knocks, and crieth,
"Rise, and let Me in!"

Death comes down with reckless foot steps
To the hall and hut;
Think you death will tarry knocking
When the door is shut?
Jesus waiteth, waiteth, waiteth;
But the door is fast:
Grieved, away thy Saviour goeth,
Death breaks in at last.

Then 'tis time to stand entreating
Christ to let thee in;
At the gate of heaven beating,
Wailing for thy sin!
Nay! alas, thou guilty creature!
Hast thou then forgot?
Jesus waited long to know thee,
Now He knows thee not!


442
Hark, sinner, while God from on

Hark, sinner, while God from on
high doth entreat thee,
And warnings with accents of
mercy doth blend;
Give ear to His voice, lest in
judgment He meet thee;
"The harvest is passing,
the summer will end."

c
"The harvest is passing,
the summer will end."
"The harvest is passing,
the summer will end."

How oft of thy danger and guilt
He hath told thee!
How oft still the message of
mercy doth send!
Haste, haste, while He waits in His
arms to enfold thee!
"The harvest is passing,
the summer will end."

Despised and rejected, at length He
may leave thee:
What anguish and horror thy
bosom will rend!
Then haste thee, O sinner, while He
will receive thee!
"The harvest is passing,
the summer will end."

The Saviour will call thee in
judgment before Him;
Oh, bow to His sceptre, and make
Him thy Friend;
Now yield Him thy heart, and make
haste to adore Him;
"Thy harvest is passing, thy
summer will end."


443
Have you any room for Jesus,

Have you any room for Jesus,
He who bore your load of sin?
As He knocks and asks admission,
Sinner, will you let Him in?

c
Room for Jesus, King of glory!
Hasten now, His word obey!
Swing the heart's door widely open!
Bid Him enter while you may!

Room for pleasure, room for. business;
But for Christ the crucified—
Not a place that He can enter
In the heart for which He died?

Have you any time for Jesus,
As in grace He calls again?
Oh, "to-day" is" time accepted,"
To-morrow you may call in vain.

Room and time now give to Jesus:
Soon will pass God's day of grace;
Soon thy heart be cold and silent,
And thy Saviour's pleadings cease.


444
O WANDERER, come to the Father's home'!

O WANDERER, come to the Father's home'!
Why wilt thou farther roam?
There's joy and rest for the weary breast
In the Father's home.

c
Then come to the Father's home;
No longer sadly roam;
There's joy and rest for the weary breast
In the Father's home.

Why linger away on the mountains cold?
Why friendless and hopeless roam?
There's bread to spare,
and there's room for all,
In the Father's home,

Oh come, and taste of the Father's love!
Return, no more to roam,
For loved ones wait at the golden gate
Of the Father's home.

Then come and rest in your Father's
Beneath its sheltering dome;
There's joy and peace that shall never cease
In the Father's home.


445
ONE there is who loves thee, waiting still for thee;

ONE there is who loves thee, waiting still for thee;
Canst thou yet reject Him? none so kind as He!
Do not grieve Him longer: come and trust Him now!
He has waited all thy days: why waitest thou?

c
One there is who loves thee: oh, receive Him now!
He has waited all the day: why waitest thou?

Tenderly He woos thee: do not slight His call;
Though thy sins are many, He'll forgive them all.
Turn to Him, repenting: He will cleanse thee now!
He is waiting at thy heart: why waitest thou?

Jesus still is waiting: sinner, why delay?

To His arms of mercy rise and haste away!
Only come believing, He will save thee now!
He is waiting at the door: why waitest thou?


446
'Tis the Saviour who would claim

'Tis the Saviour who would claim
Entrance to your heart:
Will you send your Lord away?—
Will you say—" Depart!"?
He will all your trials share,
He will cleanse you from all sin.

c
Tis your Saviour, 'tis your Saviour
standing there:.
Haste, and let Him in! let Him in!
Lest He turn away, let Him in!

No one like the Saviour knocks
At the sinner's door;
'Tis no stranger that implores,—
He has knocked before;
He has often sought your heart:
Shall He cleanse it now from sin?

Oh, how can you bid Him wait
Till another day,
When already Jesus weeps
At the long delay?
'Twas for you that Jesus died,
And 'tis you He longs to win.


447
In the land of strangers, Whither thou art gone,

In the land of strangers,
Whither thou art gone,
Hear a far voice calling,
"My son! my son!

c
Welcome, wanderer! welcome!
welcome back to home!
"Thou hast wandered far away:
come home come home!

"From the land of hunger,
Fainting, famished, lone,
Come to love and gladness,
My son! my son!

"Quit the haunts of riot,
Wasted, woe-begone;
Sick at heart and weary,
My son! my son!

"See the door still open!
Thou art still my own;
Eyes of love are on thee,
My son! my son!

"Far off thou hast wandered:
Wilt thou farther roam?
Come! and all is pardoned,
My son! my son!

"See the well-spread table,
Unforgotten one!
Here is rest and plenty,
My son! my son!

"Thou art friendless, homeless,
Hopeless, and undone;
Mine is love unchanging,
My son! my son!"


448
Only a step to Jesus! Then why not take it now?

Only a step to Jesus!
Then why not take it now?
Come, and thy sin confessing,
To H4m, thy Saviour, bow.

c
Only a step! only a step!
Come, He waits for thee;
Come, and thy sin confessing,
Thou shalt receive a blessing:
Do not reject the mercy
He freely offers thee.

Only a step to Jesus!
Believe, and thou shalt live;
Lovingly now He's waiting,
And ready to forgive.

Only a step to Jesus!
A step from sin to grace;
What has thy heart decided?
The moments fly apace.

Only a step to Jesus!
Oh, why not come, and say-
"Gladly to Thee, my Saviour,
I give myself away"?


449
Turn thee, O lost one, careworn and weary,

Turn thee, O lost one, careworn and weary,
. Lo! the Good Shepherd is pleading to-day;
Seeking to save thee, waiting to cleanse thee:
Haste to receive Him—no longer delay!

c
Tenderly calling, patiently pleading,
Hear the Good Shepherd calling to thee;
Tenderly pleading, patiently calling,
Lovingly saying, "Come unto Me!"

Still He is waiting: why wilt thou perish?
Though thou hast wandered so far from the fold—
Yet with His life-blood He has redeemed thee;
Wondrous compassion that cannot be told!

List to His message, think of His mercy!
Sinless, yet bearing thy sins on the tree;
Perfect remission, life everlasting,
Through His atonement He offers to thee.

Come in the old way, come in the true way,
Enter through Jesus, for He is the Door;
He is the Shepherd, tenderly calling;
Come in thy weakness and wander no more.


450
Oh, what will you do with Jesus!

Oh, what will you do with Jesus!
The call comes low and sweet;
And tenderly He bids you
Your burdens lay at His feet;
O soul, so sad and weary,
That sweet voice speaks to thee:
Then what will you do with Jesus?
Oh, what shall the answer be?

c
What shall the answer be?
What shall the answer be?
What will you do with Jesus?
Oh, what shall the answer be?

Oh, what will you do with Jesus?
The call comes low and clear;
The solemn words are sounding
In every listening ear;
Immortal life's in the question,
And joy through eternity:
Then what will you do with Jesus?
Oh, what shall the answer be?

Oh, think of the King of Glory—
From heaven to earth come down;
His life so pure and holy;
His death, His cross, His crown;
Of His divine compassion,
His sacrifice for thee:
Then what will you do with Jesus?
Oh, what shall the answer be?


451
Where hast thou built thine house,

Where hast thou built thine house,
Thy soul's eternal dwelling?
Upon the treacherous sands of sin,
'Mid floods and tempests swelling?

c
Oh, build upon the Rock—
the only sure foundation;
On Christ alone, the Corner-stone,
the Rock of our salvation!

What wilt thou do when storms
Upon thy house are beating?
When from beneath, the treacherous sands
That held thee are retreating?

Wait not until the floods,
With final shock appalling,
Shall come—and thou canst never save
Thy ruined house from falling.


452
"Almost persuaded" now to believe;

"Almost persuaded" now to believe;
"Almost persuaded" Christ to receive;
Seems now some soul to say,
"Go, Spirit, go Thy way,
Some more convenient day
On Thee I'll call."

"Almost persuaded, "come, come today;
"Almost persuaded, "turn not away;
Jesus invites you here,
Angels are lingering near,
Prayers rise from hearts so dear;
O wanderer, come!

"Almost persuaded, "harvest is past!
"Almost persuaded, "doom comes at last!
"Almost" cannot avail;
"Almost" is but to fail!
Sad, sad, that bitter wail—
"Almost—but lost!"


453
No longer wait, my brother; even now

No longer wait, my brother; even now
God's Spirit seeks an entrance to your heart;
Come to the cross, and to the Saviour bow;
Unbar the door: make haste, lest He depart.

c
O sinner, come to Christ, the living Way;
Still He is pleading, why not come to-day?

No longer wait, O sad and troubled soul,
His pardoning grace He offers free to all;
O weary one, that grace will make you whole:
Oh, why not hear the loving Saviour's call?

No longer wait; the Lord your God hath said,
"I will not strive for ever with your heart";
Oh come, ere yet the spark of life has fled,
And thou hast failed to choose the better part.


454
If Jesus should call you to-day, dear friend,

If Jesus should call you to-day, dear friend,
To stand at His Judgment-seat,
And you knew that this hour your life would end,
Would the summons be sad or sweet?

c
Oh, would ... you be ready ...
If Jesus should call you to-day? ...
Oh, would ... you be ready, ...
Be ready His call to obey? ...

If Jesus should call you to-day, to-day,
Oh, what would your answer be?
Could you with rejoicing His voice obey,
Be glad His dear face to see?

Oh, would you be ready to lay life down,
If Jesus should come to-day?
Would you know there awaiteth for you a crown
That never shall fade away?

Be ready, be ready! you know not when
The summons to you may come.
When you shall be missed from the haunts of men,
And enter your final doom.


455
Make room for Jesus! room, sad heart!

Make room for Jesus! room, sad heart!
Beguiled and sick of sin;
Bid every alien guest depart,
Arise, and let Him in!

c
Make room, sad heart! make room! make room!
Bid alien guests depart!
Oh, let the Master in, sad heart!
Arise, and let Him in!

Make room for Jesus! room! make room!
His hand is at the door;
He comes to banish guilt and gloom,
And bless thee more and more.

Make room for Jesus! soul of mine:
He waits response to-day;
His smile is peace, His grace divine;
Oh, turn Him not away!

Make room for Jesus! By and by,
'Mid saints and seraphim,
He'll welcome to His throne on high
The soul that welcomed Him.


456
Return, O wanderer, now return!

Return, O wanderer, now return!
And seek thy Father's face!
Those new desires which in thee bum
Were kindled by His grace.
Return! Return!

Return, O wanderer, now return!
He hears thy humble sigh;
He sees thy softened spirit mourn
When no one else is nigh. —Return!

Return, O wanderer, now return!
Thy Saviour bids thee live;
Go to His bleeding feet, and learn
How freely He'll forgive. —Return!
Response and Repentance

Return, O wanderer, now return,
And wipe the falling tear!
Thy Father calls—no longer mourn:
His love invites thee near. —Return!


457
Hasten, sinner, to be wise!

Hasten, sinner, to be wise!
Stay not for the morrow's sun;
Wisdom, if you still despise,
Harder is it to be won.

Hasten, mercy to implore!
Stay not for the morrow's sun;
Lest thy season should be o'er,
Ere this evening's stage be run.

Hasten, sinner, to return!
Stay not for the morrow's sun,
Lest thy lamp should fail to burn
Ere salvation's work is done.

Hasten, sinner, to be blest!
Stay not for the morrow's sun,
Lest perdition thee arrest,
Ere the morrow is begun.


458
Come to Jesus, ye who wander

Come to Jesus, ye who wander
Far from hope, and peace, and rest;
Scorned, neglected, and forsaken,
Sorrowful, and sore distrest.

c
Come to Jesus! Come to Jesus!
Hark! the Spirit whispers, "Come!"
Come to Jesus! Come to Jesus!
Hark! the Spirit whispers, "Come!"

Come to Jesus! He hath loved you
With a deep, abounding love;
And His heart of tenderest pity
Needs no sacrifice to move.

Come! oh come! the Master waiteth:
"Come!" the longing Bride doth say:
"Come!" He tarries whilst we linger:
He hath borne our sins away.


459
O souls in darkness groping,

O souls in darkness groping,
And longing for the light,
Believe ye that the Saviour
Can give the blind their sight?

c
Oh, look to Jesus only, with
Him is love and might;
Believe that He is able to
lead you into light.

Of old He had compassion,
The Lord of life and love,
And He is" that same Jesus,"
Enthroned in light above.

He claims your faith undoubting;
"Believe ye!" is His word:
Was ever voice so tender
By weary mortal heard?

And now that Christ is able
His promise to fulfil,
Oh, cast yourselves upon Him,
And say, "I know He will!"


460
The Spirit, O sinner, in mercy doth move

The Spirit, O sinner, in mercy doth move
Thy heart so long hardened, of sin to reprove;
Resist not the Spirit, nor longer delay;
God's gracious entreaties may end with to-day.

O child of the kingdom, from sin's service cease;
Be filled with the Spirit, with comfort and peace.
Oh, grieve not the Spirit—thy Teacher is He—
That Jesus thy Saviour may glorified be.

Denied is the temple, its beauty laid low,
On God's holy altar the embers faint glow.
By love yet rekindled, a flame may be fanned;
Oh, quench not the Spirit, the Lord is at hand!


461
How solemn are the words,

How solemn are the words,
And yet to faith how plain,
Which Jesus uttered while on earth—
"Ye must be born again!"

"Ye must be born again!"
For so hath God decreed;
No reformation will suffice—
'Tis life poor sinners need.

"Ye must be born again!"
And life in Christ must have;
In vain the soul may elsewhere go—
'Tis He alone can save.

"Ye must be born again!"
Or never enter heaven;
'Tis only blood-washed ones are there—
The ransomed and forgiven.


462
Oh, hear my cry, be gracious now to Come,

Oh, hear my cry, be gracious now to me,
Come, Great Deliverer, come!
My soul, bowed down, is longing now for Thee,
Come, Great Deliverer, come!

c
I've wandered far away o'er mountains cold,
I've wandered far away from home;
Oh, take me now, and bring me to Thy fold,
Come, Great Deliverer, come!

I have no place, no shelter from the night,
One look from Thee would give me life and light,

My path is lone, and weary are my feet,
Mine eyes look up Thy loving smile to meet,

Thou wilt not spurn contrition's broken sigh;
Regard my prayer, and hear my humble cry,


463
Afflictions, though they seem severe,

Afflictions, though they seem severe,
In mercy oft are sent;
They stopped the prodigal's career,
And caused him to repent.

c
"I'll not pine here for bread,
I'll not pine here for bread, "he cries;
"Nor starve in foreign lands:
My father's house has large supplies,
And bounteous are his hands."

"What have I gained by sin, "he said,
"But hunger, shame, and fear?
My father's house abounds in bread,
While I am starving here!"

"I'll go and tell him all I've done,
Fall down before his face;
Unworthy to be called his son,
I'll seek a servant's place."

His father saw him coming back;
He saw, he ran, he smiled,
And threw his arms around the neck
Of his rebellious child!

"O father, I have sinned—forgive!"
"Enough!" the father said:
"Rejoice, my house; my son's alive,
For whom I mourned as dead!"

'Tis thus the Lord His love reveals,
To call poor sinners home;
More than a father's love He feels,
And welcomes all that come.


464
Take me, O my Father, take me!

Take me, O my Father, take me!
Take me, save me, through Thy Son;
That which Thou wouldst have me,make me,
Let Thy will in me be done,
Long from Thee my footsteps straying,
Thorny proved the way I trod;
Weary come I now, and praying,
Take me to Thy love, my God!

Fruitless years with grief recalling,
Humbly I confess my sin;
At Thy feet, O Father, falling,
To Thy household take me in.
Freely now to Thee I proffer
This repenting heart of mine;
Freely life and soul I offer,
Gift unworthy love like Thine.

Once the world's Redeemer, dying,
Bare our sins upon the tree;
On that Sacrifice relying,
Now I look in hope to Thee:
Father, take me! all forgiving,
Fold me to Thy loving breast;
In Thy love for ever living,
I must be for ever blest!


465
Hast thou no room within thy heart,

Hast thou no room within thy heart,
Where Jesus may abide?
And canst thou say to Him, Depart
Who for thee bled and died?

Oh yes, there's room within my heart,
There's room, O Lord, for Thee:
Come in, and never more depart:
Come in; abide with me

No room for Him whose glory light,
In lowly manger laid,
Shone forth in heavenly mansions bright,
Before the worlds were made!

I will, O Lord, unbar the door!
No longer stand outside;
But come within, and evermore
In my poor heart abide.

Abide with me; through all my days
Thy presence be my light;
Then shall my mouth show forth Thy praise,
And I shall walk aright.

When comes at last the Judgment day,
And I Thy face shall see,
What joy supreme to hear Thee say,
"Come in! there's room for thee."


466
Oh, tender and sweet was the Master's voice"

Oh, tender and sweet was the Master's voice"
As He lovingly called to me:
Come over the line! it is only a step—
I am waiting, My child, for thee!"

c
"Over the line!" Hear the sweet refrain!
Angels are chanting the heavenly strain!
"Over the line"—why should I remain,
With a step between me and Jesus?

"But my sins are many, my faith is small:"
Lo! the answer came quick and clear:
"Thou needest not trust in thyself at all;
Step over the line: I am here!"

"But my flesh is weak, "I tearfully said,
"And the way I cannot see;
I fear if I try I may sadly fail,
And thus may dishonour Thee!"

Ah, the world is cold, and I cannot go back;
Press forward I surely must:
I will place my hand in His wounded palm,
Step over the line, and trust,

c
"Over the line!" Hear the sweet refrain!
 Angels are chanting the heavenly strain!
"Over the line" I will not remain;
I'll cross it and go to Jesus!


467
I come, O blessed Lord, to Thee I come to-day;

I come, O blessed Lord, to Thee
I come to-day;
I am no longer satisfied to stay away.

I will not wait until my life like
Thine shall grow;
I'll come at once—I know I've sinned:
I'll tell Thee so.

It is enough for me to know
Thou wilt receive
And cleanse my heart from every
sin if I believe.

Help me that I forget myself
in loving Thee;
And let Thine image on my
heart reflected be.

Oh, take me, Saviour crucified,
and let me prove
That those who most have been
forgiven have most of love.


468
Jesus, I will trust Thee,Trust Thee with my soul:

Jesus, I will trust Thee,
Trust Thee with my soul:
Guilty, lost, and helpless,
Thou canst make me whole.
There is none in heaven
Or on earth like Thee:
Thou hast died for sinners—
Therefore, Lord, for me.

c
In Thy love confiding,
I will seek Thy face,
Worship and adore Thee
For Thy wondrous grace.
Jesus, I will trust Thee,
Trust Thee with my soul!
Guilty, lost, and helpless,
Thou canst make me whole.

Jesus, I can trust Thee,
Trust Thy written Word;
Since Thy voice of mercy
I have often heard.
When Thy Spirit teacheth,
To my taste how sweet!
Only may I hearken,
Sitting at Thy feet.

Jesus, I do trust Thee,
Trust Thee without doubt;
"Whosoever cometh"
Thou" wilt not cast out:"
Faithful is Thy promise,
Precious is Thy blood—
These my soul's salvation,
Thou my Saviour God!


469
Like a bird on the deep, far away

Like a bird on the deep, far away
from its nest,
I had wandered, my Saviour, from Thee;
But Thy kind, loving voice called me
home to Thy breast,
And I knew there was welcome for me!

c
Welcome for me, Saviour, from Thee!
A welcome, glad welcome for me!
Now, like a dove, I rest in Thy love,
And find a sweet refuge in Thee.

I am safe in the Ark; I have folded
my wings
On the bosom of mercy Divine;
I am filled with delight by Thy
presence so bright,
And the joy that will ever be mine.

Now in Jesus I rest, and I dread not
the storm,
Though around me the surges may roll;
I will look to the skies, where the day
never dies,
I will sing of the joy in my soul.

Christ is knocking at my sad heart;

Christ is knocking at my sad heart;
Shall I let Him in?
Patiently knocking at my sad heart,
Oh, shall I let Him in?
Cold and proud is my heart with sin;
Dark and cheerless is all within:
Christ is bidding me turn unto Him;
Oh, shall I let Him in?

Shall I send Him the loving word?
Shall I let Him in?
Meekly accepting my gracious Lord,
Oh, shall I let Him in?
He can infinite love impart;
He can pardon this rebel heart:
Shall I bid Him for ever depart,—
Or shall I let Him in?

Yes, I'll open this proud heart's door;
I will let Him in!
Gladly I'll welcome Him evermore,
Oh yes, I'll let Him in!
Blessed Saviour, abide with me;
Cares and trials will lighter be;
I am safe if I'm only with Thee;
Come in, O Lord, come in!


471
I've wandered far away from God:

I've wandered far away from God:
Now I'm coming home;
The paths of sin too long I've trod:
Lord, I'm coming home.

c
Coming home, coming home,
nevermore tc roam;
By Thy grace I will be Thine:
Lord, I'm coming home,

I've wasted many precious years:
Now I'm coming home;
I now repent with bitter tears:
Lord, I'm coming home.

I'm tired of sin and straying, Lord:
Now I'm coming home;
I'll trust Thy love, believe Thy word:
Lord, I'm coming home.

My soul is sick, my heart is sore:
Now I'm coming home;
My strength renew, my hope restore:
Lord, I'm coming home.


472
Like wandering sheep o'er mountains cold,

Like wandering sheep o'er mountains cold,
Since all have gone astray;
To" Life" and peace within the fold,
How may I find the Way?

c
"I ... am the Way, ... the Truth, ... and the Life; ...
No man cometh unto the Father but by Me.
I ... am the Way, ... the Truth, ... and the Life; ...
No man cometh unto the Father but by Me."

Bewildered oft with doubt and care,
To God I fain would go;
"But while they cry, "Lo here! lo there!
The Truth how may I know?

To Christ—the Way, the Truth, the Life—
I come, no more to roam;
He'll guide me to my" Father's house,"
To my Eternal home.


473
Just as I am—without one plea,

Just as I am—without one plea,
But that Thy blood was shed for me,
And that Thou bidd'st me come to Thee,
O Lamb of God, I come!

Just as I am—poor, wretched, blind,
Sight, riches, healing of the mind;
Yea, all I need, in Thee to find,
O Lamb of God, I come!

Just as I am—Thou wilt receive,
Wilt welcome, pardon, cleanse, relieve:
Because thy promise I believe,
O Lamb of God, I come!

Just as I am—Thy love unknown
Has broken every barrier down:
Now to be Thine, yea, Thine alone,
O Lamb of God, I come!


474
Once more, my soul, thy Saviour,

Once more, my soul, thy Saviour,
through the Word,
Is offered full and free; [
And now, O Lord, I must, I must decide:
Shall I accept of Thee?

c
I will! . . I will! . . I will! God helping me
I will, O Lord, be Thine!
Thy precious blood was shed to purchase me—
I will be wholly Thine!

By grace I will Thy mercy now receive,
Thy love my heart hath won:
On Thee, O Christ, I will, I will believe,
And trust in Thee alone!

Thou knowest, Lord, how very' weak I am,
And how I fear to stray;
For strength to serve I look to Thee alone—
The strength Thou must supply!

And now, O Lord, give all with us today
The grace to join our song;
And from the heart to gladly with us say:
"I will to Christ belong!"

To all who came, when Thou wast here below
And said, "O Lord, wilt Thou?
"To them, "I will!" was ever Thy reply:
We rest upon it now.


475
I hear Thy welcome voice That calls me,

I hear Thy welcome voice
That calls me, Lord, to Thee,
For cleansing in Thy precious blood
That flowed on Calvary.

c
I am coming, Lord!
Coming now to Thee!
Wash me, cleanse me, in the blood
That flowed on Calvary.

Though coming weak and vile,
Thou dost my strength assure;
Thou dost my vileness fully cleanse,
Till spotless all and pure.

'Tis Jesus calls me on
To perfect faith and love,
To perfect hope, and peace, and trust
For earth and heaven above.

'Tis Jesus who confirms
The blessed work within,
By adding grace to welcomed grace,
Where reigned the power of sin.

And He the witness gives
To loyal hearts and free,
That every promise is fulfilled,
If faith but brings the plea.

All hail, atoning blood!
All hail, redeeming grace!
All hail, the Gift of Christ our Lord,
Our Strength and Righteousness!


476
Jesus, my Lord, to Thee I cry;

Jesus, my Lord, to Thee I cry;
Unless Thou help me, I must die:
Oh, bring Thy free salvation nigh,
And take me as I am!

c
And take me as I am! And take me as I am!
My only plea—Christ died for me!
Oh, take me as I am!

Helpless I am, and full of guilt;
But yet for me Thy blood was spilt,
And Thou canst make me what Thou wilt,
And take me as I am!

No preparation can I make,
My best resolves I only break,
Yet save me for Thine own name's sake,
And take me as I am!

Behold me, Saviour, at Thy feet,
Deal with me as Thou seest meet;
Thy work begin, Thy work complete,
But take me as I am!


477
I am coming to the cross;

I am coming to the cross;
I am poor, and weak, and blind;
I am counting all but dross;
I shall full salvation find.

c
I am trusting, Lord, in Thee,
Blessed Lamb of Calvary;
Humbly at Thy cross I bow:
Save me, Jesus, save me now.

Long my heart has sighed for Thee,
Long has evil reigned within;
Jesus sweetly speaks to me—
"I will cleanse you from all sin."

Here I give my all to Thee,
Friends, and time, and earthly store,
Soul and body Thine to be—
Wholly Thine for evermore.

Jesus comes! He fills my soul!
Perfected in Him I am;
I am every whit made whole;
Glory, glory to the Lamb!

c
Still I'm trusting, Lord, in Thee,
Blessed Lamb of Calvary;
Humbly at Thy cross I bow;
Jesus saves me, saves me now!


478
Lord, at Thy mercy-seat Humbly I fall,

Lord, at Thy mercy-seat
Humbly I fall,
Pleading Thy promise sweet—
Lord, hear my call:
Now let Thy work begin;
Oh, make me pure within,
Cleanse me from every sin,
Jesus, my all!

Tears of repentant grief
Silently fall;
Help Thou mine unbelief,
Hear Thou my call!
Oh, how I pine for Thee!
This is all my hope, my plea:
Jesus has died for me—
Jesus, my all!

Hark! how the words of love
Tenderly fall;
Ere in the realms above
Heard is my call!
Now every doubt has flown,
Broken my heart of stone;
Lord, I am Thine alone:
Jesus, my all!

Still at Thy mercy-seat
Humbly I fall;
Pleading Thy promise sweet,
Heard is my call:
Faith wings my soul to Thee;
This all my hope shall be—
Jesus has died for me,
Jesus, my all!


479
Out in the desert, seeking, seeking,

Out in the desert, seeking, seeking,
Sinner, 'tis Jesus seeking for thee;
Tenderly calling, calling, calling,
Hither, thou lost one, oh, come unto Me!

c
Jesus is calling, Jesus is calling;
Why dost thou linger? why tarry away?
Come to Him quickly, say to Him gladly „
"Lord, I am coming, coming to-day!"

Still He is waiting, waiting, waiting;
Oh, what compassion beams in His eye!
Hear Him repeating, gently, gently,
Come to thy Saviour, oh, why wilt thou die?

Lovingly pleading, pleading, pleading,
Mercy, though slighted, bears with thee yet;
Thou canst be happy, happy, happy;
Come ere the life-star for ever shall set.


480
The mistakes of my life have been many,

The mistakes of my life have been many,
The sins of my heart have been more,
And I scarce can see for weeping,
But I'll knock at the open door.

c
I know I am weak and sinful,
It comes to me more and more;
But when the dear Saviour shall
bid me come in,
I'll enter the open door.

I am lowest of those who love Him,
I am weakest of those who pray;
But I come as He has bidden,
And He will not say me nay.

My mistakes His free grace will cover,
My sins He will wash away;
And the feet that shrink and falter
Shall walk through the gates of day.

The mistakes of my life have been many,
And my spirit is sick with sin,
And I scarce can see for weeping,
But the Saviour will let me in.


481
Lone and weary, sad and dreary,

Lone and weary, sad and dreary,
Lord, I would Thy call obey;
Thee believing, Christ receiving,
I would come to Thee to-day.
I am coming, I am coming,
Coming, Saviour, to be blest;
I am coming, I am coming,
Coming, Lord, to Thee for rest!

Thou, the Holy, Meek, and Lowly,
Jesus, unto Thee I come;
Keep me ever, let me never
From Thy blessed keeping roam.

Here abiding, in Thee hiding,
Seeks my weary soul to rest;
Till the dawning of the morning,
When I wake among the blest.

Be Thou near me, keep and cheer me,
Through life's dark and stormy way;
Turn my sadness into gladness,
Turn my darkness into day.


482
I stood outside the gate,A poor, wayfaring child;

I stood outside the gate,
A poor, wayfaring child;
Within my heart there beat
A tempest loud and wild;
A fear oppressed my soul
That I might be too late!
And oh, I trembled sore,
And prayed outside the gate,
And prayed outside the gate.

"Oh, Mercy!" loud I cried,
"Now give me rest from sin!"
"I will!" a voice replied;
And Mercy let me in:
She bound my bleeding wounds,
And soothed my heart opprest;
She washed away my guilt,
And gave me peace and rest.

In Mercy's guise I knew
The Saviour long abused,
Who often sought my heart,
And wept when I refused.
Oh, what a blest return
For all my years of sin!—
I stood outside the gate,
And Jesus let me in.


483
What shall I do with Jesus?

What shall I do with Jesus?
I hear His pleading voice;
He asks that He may enter.
And make my heart rejoice.
The hand that's gently knocking
Bore cruel wounds for me;
And on His brow, so holy,
The thorn-marks yet I see.

c
What shall I do with Jesus?
For time is gliding by;
What shall I do with Jesus?
Eternity is nigh!

What shall I do with Jesus—
The Lamb of Calvary?
His wonderful salvation
He freely offers me:
His precious blood for cleansing,
The comfort of His love;
The glory of His blessing,
And life with Him above.

What shall I do with Jesus,
The King upon His throne?
He claims my full allegiance,
Redeemed me for His own.
Oh, deeply solemn question!
Lord, help me now decide,
And take Thee for my Saviour—
My Master, Friend, and Guide.


484
I was a wandering sheep,I did not love the fold;

I was a wandering sheep,
I did not love the fold;
I did not love my Shepherd's voice,
I would not be controlled:
I was a wayward child,
I did not love my home,
I did not love my Father's voice,
I loved afar to roam.

The Shepherd sought His sheep,
The Father sought His child;
They followed me o'er vale and hill,
O'er deserts waste and wild:
They found me nigh to death,
Famished, and faint, and lone;
They bound me with the bands of love,
They saved the wandering one.

Jesus my Shepherd is,
'Twas He that loved my soul;
'Twas He that washed me in His blood,
'Twas He that made me whole;
'Twas He that sought the lost,
That found the wandering sheep;
Twas He that brought me to the fold,
'Tis He that still doth keep.

I was a wandering sheep,
I would not be controlled;
But now I love my Saviour's voice,
I love, I love the fold.
I was a wayward child,
I once preferred to roam;
But now I love my Father's voice—
I love, I love His home.


485
Lord, I hear of showers of blessing

Lord, I hear of showers of blessing
Thou art scattering full and free—
Showers the thirsty land refreshing;
Let some droppings fall on me—
Even me!

Pass me not, O gracious Father!
Sinful though my heart may be:
Thou might'st leave me, but the rather
Let Thy mercy fall on me—Even me!

Pass me not, O tender Saviour,
Let me love and cling to Thee:
I am longing for Thy favour;
Whilst Thou'rt calling,
oh, call me—Even me!

Pass me not, O mighty Spirit!
Thou canst make the blind to see:
Witnesses of Jesus' merit,
Speak the word of power to me—Even me!

Love of God, so pure and changeless;
Blood of Christ, so rich and free;
Grace of God, so strong and boundless;
Magnify them all in me—Even me!

Pass me not; Thy lost one bringing,
Bind my heart, O Lord, to Thee;
While the streams of life are springing,
Blessing others, oh, bless me—Even me!


486
Depth of mercy! can there be

Depth of mercy! can there be
Mercy still reserved for me?
Can my God His wrath forbear?—
Me, the chief of sinners, spare?

I have long withstood His grace,
Long provoked Him to His face;
Would not hearken to His calls,
Grieved Him by a thousand falls.

Whence to me this waste of love?
Ask my Advocate above!
See the cause in Jesus' face,
Now before the throne of grace.

There for me the Saviour stands,
Shows His wounds, and spreads His hands;
God is love, I know, I feel;
Jesus weeps, and loves me still.

If I rightly read Thy heart,
If Thou all companion art,
Bow Thine ear, in mercy bow,
Pardon and accept me now!


487
We are coming home to Jesus,

We are coming home to Jesus,
We have heard His welcome voice;
We are trusting in His goodness.
In His mercy we rejoice.

c
We are coming ... home, we are coming ... home,
We are coming from the darkness to the light; ...
We are coming ... home, we are coming ... home,
We are coming ... home to-night.

We are coming home to Jesus,
For He died that we might live;
He is willing to receive us,
He is waiting to forgive.

We are coming home to Jesus,
By the cross, our only way;
There He finished our redemption,
And we can no more delay.


488
Pass me not, O gentle Saviour,

Pass me not, O gentle Saviour,
Hear my humble cry;
While on others Thou art calling,
Do not pass me by.

c
Saviour, Saviour, hear my humble cry
And while others Thou art calling, do
not pass me by!

Let me at a throne of mercy
Find a sweet relief;
Kneeling there in deep contrition,
Help my unbelief.

Trusting only in Thy merit,
Would I seek Thy face;
Heal my wounded, broken spirit,
Save me by Thy grace.

Thou the spring of all my comfort,
More than life to me;
Whom have I on earth beside Thee?
Whom in heaven but Thee?


489
Weary of earth, and laden with my sin,

Weary of earth, and laden with my sin,
I look at heaven, and long to enter in;
But there no evil thing may find a home,
And yet I hear a voice that bids me." Come!"

So vile I am, how dare I hope tc stand
In the pure glory of that holy land?
Before the whiteness of that throne appear?
Yet there are hands stretched out to draw me near

The while I fain would tread the heavenly way.
Seems evil ever with me day by day;
Yet on mine ears the gracious tidings fall:
"Repent, confess, and thou art loosed from all."

It is the voice of Jesus that I hear,
His are the hands outstretched to draw me near,
And His the blood that can for all atone,
And set me faultless there before the Throne.

Yea, Thou wilt answer for me, righteous Lord;
Thine all the merits, mine the great reward;
Thine the sharp thorns, and mine the golden crown;
Mine the life won, and Thine the life laid down.

Naught can I bring Thee, Lord, for all I owe,
Yet let my full heart what it can bestow:
Myself my gift, let my devotion prove,
Forgiven greatly, how I greatly love.


490
The gospel of Thy grace My stubborn heart has won;

The gospel of Thy grace
My stubborn heart has won;
For God so loved the world,
He gave His only Son,
That Whosoever will believe,
Shall everlasting life receive!

"The serpent" lifted up
"Could life and healing give,
So Jesus on the cross
Bids me to look and live;
For" Whosoever will believe,
Shall everlasting life receive!"

"The soul that sinneth dies:
"My awful doom I heard;
I was for ever lost,
But for Thy gracious word,
That" Whosoever will believe,
Shall everlasting life receive!"

"Not to condemn the world"
The" Man of Sorrows" came;
But that the world might have
Salvation through His name;
For" Whosoever will believe,
Shall everlasting life receive!"

"Lord, help my unbelief!"
Give me the peace of faith,
To rest with childlike trust
On what Thy gospel saith,
That" Whosoever will believe,
Shall everlasting life receive!"


491
Heavenly Father, bless me now,

Heavenly Father, bless me now,
At the cross of Christ I bow;
Take my guilt and grief away,
Hear and heal me now, I pray.
Bless me now! bless me now!
Heavenly Father, bless me now!

Now, O Lord, this very hour,
Send Thy grace and show Thy power;
While I rest upon Thy word,
Come and bless me now, O Lord!

Now, just now, for Jesus' sake,
Lift the clouds, the fetters break;
While I look, and as I cry,
Touch and cleanse me ere I die.

Never did I so adore
Jesus Christ, Thy Son, before;
Now the time! and this the place!
Gracious Father, show Thy grace.


492
Jesus Christ is passing by,

Jesus Christ is passing by,
Sinner, lift to Him thine eye;
As the precious moments flee,
Cry, "Be merciful to me!"

Jesus Christ is passing by,
Will He always be so nigh?
Now is the accepted day,
Seek for healing while you may.

Lo! He stands and calls to thee,
"What wilt thou then have of Me?"
Rise, and tell Him all thy need;
Rise—He calleth thee indeed.

"Lord, I would Thy mercy see;
Lord, reveal Thy love to me;
Let it penetrate my soul,
All my heart and life control."

Oh, how sweet! the touch of power
Comes,—it is salvation's hour;
Jesus gives from guilt release,
"Faith hath saved thee, go in peace!"


493
Father, I stretch my hands to Thee;

Father, I stretch my hands to Thee;
No other help I know:
If Thou withdraw Thyself from me,
Ah, whither shall I go?

c
I do believe, I do believe
That Jesus died for me;
And through His blood, His precious blood,
I shall from sin be free.

What did Thine only Son endure,
Before I drew my breath;
What pain, what labour, to secure
My soul from endless death!

O Jesus, could I this believe,
I now should feel Thy power;
And all my wants Thou wouldst relieve
In this accepted hour.

Author of faith, to Thee I lift
My weary, longing eyes:
Oh, let me now receive that gift;
My soul without it dies.


494
O JESUS, Thou art standing

O JESUS, Thou art standing
Outside the fast-closed door,
In lowly patience waiting
To pass the threshold o'er.

Oh, love that passeth knowledge,
So patiently to wait!
Oh, sin that hath no equal,
So fast to bar the gate.

O Jesus, Thou art pleading
In accents meek and low:
"I died for you, My children,
And will ye treat Me so?"

O Lord, with shame and sorrow
We open now the door:
Dear Saviour, enter, enter,
And leave us nevermore!


495
Jesus, Saviour, hear my call,

Jesus, Saviour, hear my call,
While at Thy feet I humbly fall:
To Thee, my Hope, my Life, my all,
O blessed Lord, I come!

c
I come—and this my only plea.
That Thou didst give Thyself for me;
And casting all my care on Thee,
O blessed Lord, I come.

I have no merit of my own,
Thou only canst for sin atone;
And looking up to Thee alone,
O blessed Lord, I come!

Thy precious name salvation brings,
To Thee my weary spirit clings;
And now, to rest beneath Thy wings,
O blessed Lord, I come!

Oh, take this wandering heart of mine,
And seal it, Lord, for ever Thine;
That I may know Thy love Divine,
O blessed Lord, I come!


496
Oh, what shall I do to be saved

Oh, what shall I do to be saved
From the sorrows that burden my soul?
Like the waves in the storm
When the winds are at war,
Chilling floods of distress o'er me roll.

c
What shall I do? what shall I do?
Oh, what shall I do to be saved?

Oh, what shall I do to be saved,
When the pleasures of youth are all fled:
And the friends I have loved
From the earth are removed,
And I weep o'er the graves of the dead?

Oh, what shall I do to be saved,
When sickness my strength shall sub-due;
Or the world in a day,
Like a cloud, rolls away,
And eternity opens to view?

O Lord, look in mercy on me,
Come, come, and speak peace to my soul!
Unto whom shall I flee,
Blessed Lord, but to Thee?
Thou canst make my poor broken heart whole!

c
That will I do! that will I do!
To Jesus I'll go and be saved!


497
my Saviour, hear me, Draw me close to Thee;

my Saviour, hear me,
Draw me close to Thee;
Thou hast paid my ransom,
Thou hast died for me;
Now by simple faith I claim
Pardon through Thy gracious name;
Thou, my Ark of safety,
Let me fly to Thee.

O my Saviour, bless me,
Bless me while I pray;
Grant Thy grace to help me,
Take my fear away;
I believe Thy promise, Lord;
I will trust Thy holy Word;
Thou, my soul's Redeemer,
Bless me while I pray.

O my Saviour, love me,
Make me all Thine own;
Leave me not to wander
In this world alone:
Bless my way with light divine,
Let Thy glory round me shine;
Thou, my Rock, my Refuge,
Make me all Thine own.

O my Saviour, guard me,
Keep me evermore!
Bless me, love me, guide me,
Till my work is o'er:
May I then, with glad surprise,
Chant Thy praise beyond the skies;
There with Thee, my Saviour,
Dwell for evermore.


498
Out of my bondage, sorrow, and night,

Out of my bondage, sorrow, and night,
Jesus, I come! Jesus, I come!
Into Thy freedom, gladness, and light,
Jesus, I come to Thee!
Out of my sickness into Thy health,
Out of my want and into Thy wealth,
Out of my sin and into Thyself,
Jesus, I come to Thee!

Out of my shameful failure and loss,
Jesus I come! Jesus, I come!
Into the glorious gain of Thy cross,
Jesus, I come to Thee!
Out of earth's sorrows into Thy balm,
Out of life's storm and into Thy calm,
Out of distress to jubilant psalm,
Jesus, I come to Thee!

Out of unrest and arrogant pride,
Jesus, I come! Jesus, I come!
Into Thy blessed will to abide,
Jesus, I come to Thee!
Out of myself to dwell in Thy love,
Out of despair into raptures above,
Upward for aye on wings like a dove,
Jesus, I come to Thee!

Out of the fear and dread of the tomb,
Jesus, I come! Jesus, I come!
Into the joy and light of Thy home,
Jesus, I come to Thee!
Out of the depths of ruin untold,
Into the peace of Thy sheltering fold,
Ever Thy glorious face to behold,
Jesus, I come to Thee!


499
I was wandering, sad, and weary,

I was wandering, sad, and weary,
When the Saviour came unto me;
For the paths of sin were dreary,
And the world had ceased to woo me:
And I thought I heard Him say,
As He came along His way:

c
"Wandering souls, O do come near Me;
My sheep should never fear Me:
I am the Shepherd true,
I am the Shepherd true!"

At first I would not hearken,
But put off till the morrow,
Till life began to darken,
And I grew sick with sorrow:
Then I thought I heard Him say,
As He came along His way:

At last I stopped to listen—
His voice could ne'er deceive me—
I saw His kind eye glisten,
So anxious to relieve me:
Then I knew I heard Him say,
As He came along His way:

I thought His love would weaken
As more and more He knew me,
But it burneth like a beacon,
And its light and heat go through me;
And I ever hear Him say,
As He goes along His way:


500
One is our Master, the blessed Redeemer,

One is our Master, the blessed Redeemer,
Strong is the bond that unites us in Him;
Oh may the love His own Spirit hath kindled
Burn with a light that will never grow dim.

c
Brethren in Jesus, let us be faithful,
Faithful to Him who is guiding our ways;
True in allegiance and loving obedience,
Till in His glory hosannas we raise.

One is our Master; with gladness we'll serve Him,
"Doing the will" of the Lord" from the heart,"
Knowing His strength is made perfect in weakness—
All that is needful His grace will impart.


One is our Master, the highest and noblest,
Yet in His tenderness always" the same";
Be it our honour to follow His banner,
Blessing for ever be unto His name.

One is our Master; and happy those servants,
Watching and ready when'er He may come;
Changed in His image, from" glory to glory, "
Joyful reward in His kingdom and home.


501
In the heavenly pastures fair,

In the heavenly pastures fair,
'Neath the tender Shepherd's care,
Let us rest beside the living stream today;
Calmly there in peace recline,;
Drinking in the truth divine, [
As His loving call we now with joy obey.

c
Glorious stream of life eternal,
Beauteous fields of living green,
Thou revealed within the Word
Of our Shepherd and our Lord,
By the pure in heart alone can they be seen

Far from all the noise and strife
That disturb our daily life,
Let us pause awhile in silence and adore;
Then the sound of His dear voice
Will our waiting souls rejoice,
As He nameth us His own for ever- more.

Oh, how good, and true, and kind,
Seeking His stray sheep to find,
If they wander into danger from His side!
Ever closely may we tread
Where His holy feet have led;
So at last with Him in heaven we may abide.


502
I would commune with Thee, my God:

I would commune with Thee, my God:
E'en to Thy seat I come:
I leave my joys, I leave my sins,
And seek in Thee my home.

I stand upon the mount of God,
With sunlight in my soul;
I hear the storms in vales beneath,
I hear the thunders roll;

But I am calm with Thee, my God,
Beneath these glorious skies;
And to the height on which I stand,
Nor storms nor clouds can rise.

Oh, this is life! Oh, this is joy,
My God, to find Thee so!
Thy face to see, Thy voice to hear,
And all Thy love to know!


503
Walk in the light, so shalt thou know

Walk in the light, so shalt thou know
That fellowship of love
His Spirit only can bestow,
Who reigns in light above.

Walk in the light, and thou shalt find
Thy heart made truly His
Who dwells in cloudless light enshrined,
In whom no darkness is.

Walk in the light—and sin abhorred
Shall not defile again;
The blood of Jesus Christ the Lord
Shall cleanse from every stain.

Walk in the light, and e'en the tomb
No fearful shade shall wear;
Glory shall chase away its gloom,
For Christ hath conquered there.

Walk in the light, and thou shalt own
Thy darkness passed away,
Because that light hath on thee shone,
In which is perfect day.

Walk in the light—thy path shall be
Peaceful, serene, and bright;
For God, by grace, shall dwell in thee
And God Himself is Light.

Sons of God, beloved in Jesus!

Sons of God, beloved in Jesus!
Oh, the wondrous word of grace!
In His Son the Father sees us,
And as sons He gives us place.

c
Beloved, now are we the sons of God,
And it doth not yet appear what we shall be
But we know ... that when He shall appear,
We know ... that when He shall appear,
We shall be like Him; we shall be like Him,
For we shall see Him as He is.

Blessed hope, now brightly beaming,
On our God we soon shall gaze;
And in light celestial gleaming,
We shall see our Saviour's face.

By the power of grace transforming,
We shall then His image bear;
Christ His promised word performing,
We shall then His glory share.


505
Praise the Saviour, ye who know Him;

Praise the Saviour, ye who know Him;
Who can tell how much we owe Him?
Gladly let us render to Him
All we are and have.

"Jesus" is the name that charms us;
He for conflicts fits and arms us;
Nothing moves and nothing harms us,
When we trust in Him.

Trust in Him, ye saints, for ever;
He is faithful, changing never;
Neither force nor guile can sever
Those He loves from Him.

Keep us, Lord, oh, keep us cleaving
To Thyself, and still believing,
Till the hour of our receiving
Promised joys in heaven.

Then we shall be where we would be,
Then we shall be what we should be;
Things which are not now, nor could
Then shall be our own. be,


506
Blest be the tie that binds

Blest be the tie that binds
Our hearts in Christian love;
The fellowship of kindred minds
Is like to that above.

Before our Father's throne
We pour our ardent prayers;
Our fears, our hopes, our aims are one,
Our comforts and our cares.

We share our mutual woes,
Our mutual burdens bear;
And often for each other flows
The sympathising tear.

When we asunder part
It gives us inward pain;
But we shall still be joined in heart,
And hope to meet again.


507
Onward, upward, homeward! joyfully I flee

Onward, upward, homeward! joyfully I flee
From this world of sorrow, with my Lord to be:
Onward to the glory; upward to the prize;
Homeward to the mansions far above the skies.

c
Onward to the glory! upward to the prize!
Homeward to the mansions far above the skies!

Onward, upward, homeward! here I find no rest;
Treading o'er the desert which my Saviour pressed.
Onward, upward, homeward! I shall soon be there;
Soon its joys and pleasures I, through grace, shall share.

Onward, upward, homeward! come along with me;
Ye who love the Saviour, bear me company.
Onward, upward, homeward! press with vigour on;
Yet a little moment, and the race is won.


508
Rejoice in the Lord! His mercy cheer;

Rejoice in the Lord! His mercy cheer;
He sunders the bands that enthrall;
Redeemed by His blood, why should we ever fear—
Since Jesus is our" all in all"?

c
"If God be for us, if God be for us, if God be for us,
Who can be against us?
Who? . . . who? . . . who? . . .
Who can be against us, against us?

Be strong in the Lord! rejoicing in His might,
Be loyal and true day by day;
When evils assail, be valiant for the right,
And He will be our strength and stay.

Confide in His Word—His promises so sure;
In Christ they are"yea and amen";
Though earth pass away, they ever shall endure,
'Tis written o'er and 'oer again.

Abide in the Lord: secure in His control,
'Tis life everlasting begun;
To pluck from His hand the weakest trembling soul—
It never, never can be done!


509
We are out on the ocean sailing,

We are out on the ocean sailing,
Homeward bound we sweetly glide;
We are out on the ocean sailing,
To a home beyond the tide.

c
All the storms will soon be over,
Then we'll anchor in the harbour;
We are out on the ocean sailing
To a home beyond the tide.

Millions now are safely landed,
Over on the golden shore;
Millions more are on their journey,
Yet there's room for millions more.

Spread your sails, while heavenly breezes
Gently waft our vessel on;
All on board are sweetly singing—
Free salvation is the song.

When we all are safely anchored,
We will shout—our trials o'er;
We will walk about the city,
And we'll sing for evermore.


510
The dear old story of a Saviour's love

The dear old story of a Saviour's love
Is sweeter as the days go by;
The glad assurance of a home above
Is sweeter as the days go by.

c
We'll fill . . the days with joy - - ful praise.
We'll sing as the happy moments fly; . ...
The song of love to Him above
Grows sweeter as the days go by.

The sunbeams shining from the living light
Are brighter as the days go by;
The stars of promise cheering sor- row's night
Are brighter as the days go by.

Hope's anchor, holding in the stormy strife,
Is stronger as the days go by;
We feel the throbbings of immortal
life Grow stronger as the days go by.

The peace that Jesus gives to us anew
Is deeper as the days go by;
The prospects opening to the Christian's view
Are grander as the days go by.


511
Come, let us all unite to sing:

Come, let us all unite to sing:
God is love! God is love!
While heaven and earth their praises bring:
God is love! God is love!
Let every soul from sin awake,
Each in his heart sweet music make,
And sweetly sing for Jesus' sake:
God is love! God is love!

Oh, tell to earth's remotest bound:
God is love! God is love!
In Christ is full redemption found:
God is love! God is love!
His blood can cleanse our sins away;
His Spirit turns our night to day.
And leads our souls with joy to say,
God is love! God is love!

How happy is our portion here!
God is love! God is love!
His promises our spirits cheer:
God is love! God is love!
He is our Sun and Shield by day,
By night He near our tents will stay—
He will be with us all the way:
God is love! God is love!

What though my heart and flesh shall fail:
God is love! God is love!
Through Christ I shall o'er death prevail:
God is love! God is love!
E'en Jordan's swell I will not fear,
For Jesus will be with me there,
My soul above the waves to bear;
God is love! God is love!


512
A few more marchings weary,

A few more marchings weary,
Then we'll gather home!
A few more storm-clouds dreary,
Then we'll gather home!
A few more days the cross to bear,
And then with Christ a crown to wear;
A few more marchings weary,
Then we'll gather home!

c
O'er ... time's ... rapid river,
Soon ... we'll ... rest for ever
No more marchings weary
When we gather home!

A few more nights of weeping,
Then we'll gather home!
A few more watches keeping,
Then we'll gather home!
A few more victories over sin,
A few more sheaves to gather in,
A few more marchings weary,
Then we'll gather home!

A few more sweet links broken,
Then we'll gather home!
A few more kind words spoken,
Then we'll gather home!
A few more partings on the strand,
And then away to Canaan's land:
A few more marchings weary,
Then we'll gather home!


513
O God, our help in ages past,

O God, our help in ages past,
Our hope for years to come,
Our shelter from the stormy blast,
And our eternal home.

Under the shadow of Thy throne
Thy saints have dwelt secure;
Sufficient is Thine arm alone,
And our defence is sure.

Before the hills in order stood,
Or earth received her frame,
From everlasting Thou art God,
To endless years the same.

A thousand ages in Thy sight
Are like an evening gone;
Short as the watch that ends the night
Before the rising sun.

Time, like an ever-rolling stream,
Bears all its sons away;
They fly forgotten, as a dream
Dies at the opening day.

O God, our help in ages past,
Our hope for years to come,
Be Thou our guard while life shall last,
And our eternal home.


514
O God of Bethel! by whose hand

O God of Bethel! by whose hand
Thy people still are fed,
Who through this weary pilgrimage
Hast all our fathers led:

Our vows, our prayers, we now present
Before Thy throne of grace:
God of our fathers, be the God
Of their succeeding race!

Through each perplexing path of life
Our wandering footsteps guide:
Give us each day our daily bread,
And raiment fit provide.

Oh, spread Thy covering wings around,
Till all our wanderings cease,
And at our Father's loved abode
Our souls arrive in peace.

Such blessings from Thy gracious hand
Our humble prayers implore,
And Thou shalt be our chosen God
And portion evermore.


515
When all Thy mercies, O my God,

When all Thy mercies, O my God,
My rising soul surveys,
Transported with the view, I'm lost
In wonder, love, and praise.

Unnumbered comforts on my soul
Thy tender care bestowed,
Before my infant heart conceived
From whom these comforts flowed.

When worn with sickness, oft hast Thou
With health renewed my face;
And when in sins and sorrows sunk,
Revived my soul with grace.

Ten thousand thousand precious gifts
My daily thanks employ;
Nor is the least a cheerful heart
That tastes those gifts with joy.

Through every period of my life
Thy goodness I'll pursue;
And after death, in distant worlds,
The glorious theme renew.

Through all eternity to Thee
A joyful song I'll raise;
But oh, eternity's too short
To utter all Thy praise!


516
God moves in a mysterious way

God moves in a mysterious way
His wonders to perform;
He plants His footsteps in the sea,
And rides upon the storm.

Deep in unfathomable mines
Of never-failing skill,
He treasures up His bright designs,
And works His sovereign will.

Ye fearful saints, fresh courage take!
The clouds ye so much dread
Are big with mercy, and will break
In blessings on your head.

Judge not the Lord by feeble sense,
But trust Him for His grace;
Behind a frowning providence
He hides a smiling face.

His purposes will ripen fast,
Unfolding every hour;
The bud may have a bitter taste,
But sweet will be the flower.

Blind unbelief is sure to err.
And scan His work in vain;
God is His own interpreter,
And He will make it plain.


517
God will take care of you, be not afraid,

God will take care of you, be not afraid,
He is your safeguard through sun-shine and shade;
Tenderly watching and keeping His own,
He will not leave you to wander alone.
God will take care of you still to the end;
Oh, what a Father, Redeemer, and Friend!
Jesus will answer whenever you call;
He will take care of you; trust Him for all!

God will take care of you through all the day,
Shielding your footsteps, directing your way;
He is your Shepherd, Protector, and Guide.
Leading His children where still waters glide.

God will take care of you, long as you live,
Granting you blessings no other can give;
He will take care of you when time is past,
Safe to His kingdom will bring you at last.


518
He leadeth His own with a gentle hand,

He leadeth His own with a gentle hand,
A wonderful Saviour have we!
Oh, where is the friend that on earth we can find
So full of compassion as He?

c
Won derful Saviour, won derful Saviour
Watching so tenderly o'er us!
Shedding bright sunshine before us;
Glory, honour, and praise ... to His name!

He leadeth His own with a gentle hand,
Whenever we faint by the way;
How precious the blessings that fall from His throne,
Like dew at the close of the day!

He leadeth His own with a gentle hand,
And when we are sorrow-oppressed,
He gathers us under the shade of His love,
And there on His bosom we rest.

He leadeth His own with a gentle hand,
And oh, when our journey is o'er,
What rapture in Eden to sit at His feet,
And praise Him when time is no more!


519
Oh, safe to the Rock that is higher than I,

Oh, safe to the Rock that is higher than I,
My soul in its conflicts and sorrows would fly;
So sinful, so weary, Thine, Thine would I be;

c
Thou blest" Rock of Ages, "I'm hiding in Thee.
Hiding in Thee, hiding in Thee,
Thou blest" Rock of Ages, "I'm hiding in Thee.

In the calm of the noontide, in sorrow's lone hour,
In times when temptation casts o'er me its power;
In the tempests of life, on its wide, heaving sea,
Thou blest" Rock of Ages, "I'm hiding in Thee.

How oft in the conflict, when pressed by the foe,
I have fled to my Refuge and breathed out my woe;
How often when trials like sea-billows roll,
Have I hidden in Thee, O Thou Rock of my soul.


520
Hide me, O my Saviour, hide me

Hide me, O my Saviour, hide me
In Thy holy place;
Resting there beneath Thy glory,
Oh, let me see Thy face.

c
Hide . me! . hide . me!
O blessed Saviour, hide me!
O . Saviour, keep . me
Safely, O Lord, with Thee!

Hide me, when the storm is raging
O'er life's troubled sea;
Like a dove on ocean's billows,
Oh, let me fly to Thee!

Hide me, when my heart is breaking
With its weight of woe;
When in tears I seek the comfort
Thou canst alone bestow.


521
In the shadow of the Highest

In the shadow of the Highest
My defence shall ever be,
For His eye, that never sleepeth,
Still is watching over me.

c
I am dwell ing in the shadow . . .
Of the migh ty King of kings; . . .
With His feath ers I am covered, . . .
And I rest . . . beneath His wings. . . .

In the shadow of the Highest
I am safe from dread alarms,
For beneath me and around me
Are His everlasting arms.

In the shadow of the Highest,
There no evil can befal—
He's my Hope, my Shield, and Buckler,
My Deliverer and my All.


522
All the way my Saviour leads me;

All the way my Saviour leads me;
What have I to ask beside?
Can I doubt His tender mercy,
Who through life has been my Guide?
Heavenly peace, divinest comfort,
Here by faith in Him to dwell!
For I know, whate'er befal me,
Jesus doeth all things well.

All the way my Saviour leads me,
Cheers each winding path I tread,
Gives me grace for every trial,
Feeds me with the living bread.
Though my weary steps may falter,
And my soul athirst may be,
Gushing from the Rock before me,
Lo, a spring of joy I see.

All the way my Saviour leads me;
Oh, the fulness of His love!
Perfect rest to me is promised
In my Father's house above.
When my spirit, clothed immortal,
Wings its flight to realms of day,
This my song through endless ages—
Jesus led me all the way!


523
Lead me now and lead me ever,

Lead me now and lead me ever,
Lest my feet should turn aside
From the path of love and duty,
From the Cross where Thou hast died.

c
Lead me now and lead me ever,
Till beyond the crystal sea,
Through the bright and shining portals,
I shall come and dwell with Thee.

Thou the great and only centre
Of my love and highest praise,
Let my soul, revolving round Thee,
Catch Thy pure, celestial rays.

Keep me, Lord, for well Thou knowest
How I need Thy grace divine,
From the thoughts that oft beguile me,
Still to shield this heart of mine.


524
Guide me, O Thou great Jehovah,

Guide me, O Thou great Jehovah,
Pilgrim through this barren land;
I am weak, but Thou art mighty;
Hold me with Thy powerful hand
Bread of heaven,
Feed me till I want no more.

Open now the crystal fountain,
Whence the healing waters flow;
Let the fiery, cloudy pillar,
Lead me all my journey through:
Strong Deliverer,
Be Thou still my strength and shield.

When I tread the verge of Jordan,
Bid my anxious fears subside;
Bear me through the swelling current,
Land me safe on Canaan's side:
Songs of praises
I will ever give to Thee!


525
Thou art my Rock, O blessed Redeemer,

Thou art my Rock, O blessed Redeemer,
Thou art my Refuge where I may hide;
Thou art my Rock to shelter and bless me;
Ever in Thee I safely abide.

c
Thou art my Rock, ... O blessed Redeemer, ...
Thou art my Friend, ... and Thou art my Guide; ...
Thou art my Hope, ... and Thou art my Saviour, ...
Thou art my Trust; ... in Thee will I hide. ...

Thou art my Rock when sin is inviting,
Thou art my Rock when trial is near;
Thou art my Rock when sorrow is smiting,
Thou art my Rock; why then should I fear?

Thou art my Rock, temptations defying,
Thou art my Friend unchanging and sure;
Wholly on Thee my soul is relying,
Ever to keep me faithful and pure.

Thou art my Rock; when kingdom and nation,
Ruler and crown, have crumbled to dust;
Thou shalt remain my Rock of salvation,
Rock everlasting, Thee will I trust.


526
How firm a foundation, ye saints of the Lord,

How firm a foundation, ye saints of the Lord,
Is laid for your faith in His excellent Word!
What more can He say, than to you He hath said—
To you, who for refuge to Jesus have fled?

"Fear not, I am with thee; oh, be not dismayed!
For I am thy God, I will still give thee aid;
I'll strengthen thee, help thee, and cause thee to stand,
Upheld by My gracious, omnipotent hand.

"When through the deep waters I call thee to go,
The rivers of sorrow shall not overflow,
For I will be with thee, thy trials to bless,
And sanctify to thee thy deepest distress.

"When through fiery trials thy pathway shall lie,
My grace, all-sufficient, shall be thy supply:
The flame shall not hurt thee: I only design
Thy dross to consume, and thy gold to refine.

"E'en down to old age all My people shall prove
My sovereign, eternal, unchangeable love;
And then, when grey hairs shall their temples adorn,
Like lambs they shall still in My bosom be borne.

"The soul that on Jesus hath leaned for repose,
I will not—I will not desert to its foes;
That soul—though all hell should endeavour to shake—
I'll never—no, never—no, never forsake!"


527
Thou art, O Lord, my Hiding Place;

Thou art, O Lord, my Hiding Place;
My soul beneath Thy care
May fold its wings in perfect peace,
And fear no danger there.

c
My Hiding Place, my Hiding Place,
When stormy billows roll;
My Rock, my Hope, my sure Defence,
The Anchor of my soul.

Thou art, O Lord, my Hiding Place
From storm and tempest wild;
For naught can harm the humblest one
Whom Thou hast made Thy child.

Thou art, O Lord, my Hiding Place
From strong temptation's power;
For Thou hast promised by Thy grace
To keep me hour by hour.

Thou art, O Lord, my Hiding Place:
My life is hid with Thee;
Lord, Thou art mine, and I am Thine,
Through all eternity.

Like a shepherd, tender, true,Jesus leads,

Like a shepherd, tender, true,
Jesus leads, Jesus leads!
Daily finds us pastures new,
Jesus leads, Jesus leads!
Though the mists hang o'er the way,
Or the flock 'mid danger feeds,
He will watch them lest they stray—
Jesus leads, Jesus leads!

All along life's rugged road Jesus leads!
Till we reach yon blest abode, Jesus leads!
All the way, before, He's trod,
And He now the flock precedes:
Safe into the fold of God Jesus leads!

Through the sunlit ways of life Jesus leads!
Through the warrings and the strife Jesus leads!
When we reach the Jordan's tide,
Where life's boundary line recedes,
He will turn the waves aside—
Jesus leads, Jesus leads!


529
Down in the valley with my Saviour

Down in the valley with my Saviour I would go,
Where the flowers are blooming and the sweet waters flow;
Everywhere He leads me I would follow, follow on,
Walking in His footsteps till the crown be won.

c
Follow! follow! I would follow Jesus!
Anywhere, everywhere, I would follow on!
Follow! follow! I would follow Jesus!
Everywhere He leads me I would follow one


Down in the valley with my Saviour I would go,
Where the storms are sweeping and the dark waters flow;
With His hand to lead me I will never, never fear:
Dangers cannot fright me if my Lord is near,

Down in the valley, or upon the mountain steep,
Close beside my Saviour, would my soul ever keep;
He will lead me safely, in the path that He has trod,
Up to where they gather on the hills of God.


530
With my Saviour ever near to guide me,

With my Saviour ever near to guide me,
I am safe, whatever may betide me;
From the storm and tempest He will hide me
In the hollow of His hand!

c
In the hollow ... of His hand I . . .
In the hollow ... of His hand I . . .
I am safe whatever may betide me,
In the hollow of His hand!

In His arms of love He doth enfold me;
Words of peace His voice divine hath told me;
I am safe, for God Himself doth hold me
In the hollow of His hand!

He will guard my soul, and leave me never;
From His love no power on earth shall sever;
And I know He'll keep me now and ever
In the hollow of His hand!


531
In the shadow of the Rock Let me rest,

In the shadow of the Rock
Let me rest, let me rest,
When I feel the tempest shock
Thrill my breast, thrill my breast;
All in vain the storm shall sweep,
While I hide, while I hide,
And my tranquil station keep,
By Thy side.

c
O my Saviour, blessed Rock!
Let me hide, let me hide;
And for ever in Thy cleft Safe abide.
Till the storms of life are past,
With their cold and chilly blast,
And I'm anchored safe at last,
By Thy side!

On the parched and desert way,
Where I tread, where I tread,
With the scorching noontide ray
O'er my head, o'er my head;
Let me find a welcome shade,
Cool and still, cool and still,
And my weary steps be stayed,
While I will.

I in peace will rest me there
Till I see, till I see
That the skies again are fair
Over me, over me;
That the burning heat is past,
And the day, and the day
Bids the traveller go at last
On his way.


532
Take Thou my hand, and lead me to say.

Take Thou my hand, and lead me to say.
Choose Thou my way!
"Not as I will, "O Father, teach me
What though the storms may gather,
Thou knowest best;
Safe in Thy holy keeping, there would I rest.

Take Thou my hand, and lead me of mine:
Lord, I am Thine!
Fill with Thy Holy Spirit this heart
Then in the hour of trial Strong shall I be,
Ready to do, or suffer, dear Lord, for Thee.

Take Thou my hand, and lead me,
Lord, as I go;
Into Thy perfect image help me to grow.
Still in Thine own pavilion Shelter Thou me;
Keep me, O Father, keep me close, close to Thee!


533
Tenderly guide us, O Shepherd of love,

Tenderly guide us, O Shepherd of love,
To the green pastures and waters above,
Guarding us ever by night and by day,
Never from Thee would we stray.

c
Never! . . . never! . . .
Never! oh, never! for Thou art the way
Never! . . . never! . . .
Never from Thee would we stray.

What though the heavens with clouds
be o'ercast!—
Fearful the tempest, and bitter the blast!
Still with the light of Thy Word on the way,
Never from Thee would we stray.

Over our weakness Thy strength has been cast;
Keep us in meekness, Thine own till the last;
Then, safely folded, with joy we shall say,
Never from Thee would we stray.


534
Leave me not, for I am lonely,

Leave me not, for I am lonely,
And the way I cannot see;
Lest I wander into danger,
Keep me, Saviour, near to Thee.

c
Sa - viour, . Sa - viour, .
Keep me near to Thee; . . .
Lest I wander into danger,
Keep me, Saviour, aear to Thee.

Leave me not, for darkness gathers
Round about the path I tread;
Leave me not, but let thy footsteps
Ever by Thy hand be led.

Leave me not, for sin is near me;
With temptation life is fraught;
Then through all life's toilsome journey,
O my Saviour, leave me not!


535
In the secret of His presence He will hide me,

In the secret of His presence He will hide me,
From the burden of a weary world of care;
Overshadowed by His mercy, calmly resting,
My Redeemer will protect me there.

c
He will hide ... me, . safety hide ... me,.
Where no sorrow nor temptation can betide me;
He will hide . . . me, . safely hide . . . me; .
In the secret of His presence He will hide me.

In the secret of His presence He will hide me,
And the brightness of His glory He will show:
While He covers me with light as with a garment,
Oh the rapture that my heart will know!

In the secret of His presence He will hide me,

In the secret of His blessed, boundless love;
There communing and abiding with my Saviour,
What a foretaste of the joys above!


536
Thou art my hiding-place, O Lord!

Thou art my hiding-place, O Lord!
In Thee I put my trust;
Encouraged by Thy holy Word,
A feeble child of dust:
I have no argument beside,
I urge no other plea;
And 'tis enough my Saviour died,
My Saviour died for me!

When storms of fierce temptation beat,
And furious foes assail,
My refuge is the mercy-seat,
My hope within the vail:
From strife of tongues and bitter words
My spirit flies to Thee;
Joy to my heart the thought affords—
My Saviour died for me!

And when Thine awful voice commands
This body to decay,
And life in its last lingering sands
Is ebbing fast away—
Then, though it be in accents weak,
My voice shall call on Thee,
And ask for strength in death to speak,
"My Saviour died for me!"


537

Gently down the stream of time,
Lead me, Saviour, all the way.

Thou the refuge of my soul, ...
When life's stormy billows roll,.
I am safe when Thou art nigh,.
On Thy mercy I rely. ...

Saviour, lead me, till at last, ...
When the storm of life is past,.
I shall reach the land of day, ...
Where all tears are wiped away..

Lead us, Heavenly Father, lead us

Lead us, Heavenly Father, lead us
O'er the world's tempestuous sea;
Guide us, guard us, keep us, feed us,
For we have no help but Thee;
Yet possessing every blessing,
If our God our Father be.

Saviour, breathe forgiveness o'er us,
All our weakness Thou dost know;
Thou didst tread the earth before us,
Thou didst feel its keenest woe;
Lone and dreary, faint and weary,
Through the desert Thou didst go.

Spirit of our God descending,
Fill our hearts with heavenly joy;
Love with every feeling blending,
Pleasures that can never cloy:
Thus provided, pardoned, guided,
Nothing can our peace destroy.


539

A weary land, a weary land;
Oh, Jesus is a Rock in a weary land
A shelter in the time of storm!

No fears alarm, no foes affright:
A shelter in the time of storm!
Divine Protection and Guidance

The raging storms may round us beat:
A shelter in the time of storm!
We'll never leave our safe retreat,
A shelter in the time of storm!

O Rock divine, O Refuge dear:
A shelter in the time of storm!
Be Thou our helper ever near,
A shelter in the time of storm!

A wonderful Saviour is Jesus, my Lord,
A wonderful Saviour to me;
He hideth my soul in the cleft of the rock,
Where rivers of pleasure I see.

c
He hideth my soul in the cleft of the rock,
That shadows a dry, thirsty land;
He hideth my life in the depths of His love,
And covers me there with His hand.

A wonderful Saviour is Jesus, my Lord,
He taketh my burden away;
He holdeth me up, and I shall not be moved,
He giveth me strength as my day.

With numberless blessings each moment He crowns,
And, filled with His goodness divine,
I sing in my rapture, oh, glory to God
For such a Redeemer as mine!

When clothed in His brightness,
transported I rise
To meet Him in clouds of the sky,
His perfect salvation, His wonderful love,
I'll shout with the millions on high.


541
Under His wings I am safely abiding;

Under His wings I am safely abiding;
Though the night deepens and tempests are wild,
Still I can trust Him—I know He will keep me;
He has redeemed me, and I am His child.

c
Under His wings, under His wings,
Who from His love can sever?
Under His wings my soul shall abide,
Safely abide for ever.

Under His wings, what a refuge in sorrow!
How the heart yearningly turns to its rest!
Often when earth has no balm for my healing,
There I find comfort, and there I am blest.

Under His wings, oh, what precious enjoyment!
There will I hide till life's trials are o'er;
Sheltered, protected, no evil can harm me;
Resting in Jesus I'm safe evermore.


542
He leadeth me! O blessed thought!

He leadeth me! O blessed thought!
O words with heavenly comfort fraught!
Whate'er I do, where'er I be,
Still 'tis God's hand that leadeth me.

c
He leadeth me! He leadeth me!
By His own hand He leadeth me;
His faithful follower I would be,
For by His hand He leadeth me.

Sometimes 'mid scenes of deepest gloom,
Sometimes where Eden's bowers bloom,
By waters calm, o'er troubled sea—
Still 'tis God's hand that leadeth me.

Lord, I would clasp Thy hand in mine,
Nor ever murmur, nor repine;
Content, whatever lot I see,
Since 'tis my God that leadeth me.

And when my task on earth is done,
When, by Thy grace, the victory's won,
E'en death's cold wave I will not flee,
Since Thou through Jordan leadest me.


543
Precious promise God hath given

Precious promise God hath given
To the weary passer-by,
On the way from earth to heaven,
"I will guide thee with Mine eye."

c
"I will guide thee, I will guide thee
I will guide thee with Mine eye;
On the way from earth to heaven,
I will guide thee with Mine eye."

When temptations almost win thee,
And thy trusted watchers fly,
Let this promise ring within thee:
"I will guide thee with Mine eye."

When thy secret hopes have perished
In the grave of years gone by,
Let this promise still be cherished,
"I will guide thee with Mine eye."

When the shades of life are falling,
And the hour has come to die,
Hear thy trusty Leader calling,
"I will guide thee with Mine eye."


544
Where my Saviour's hand is guiding,

Where my Saviour's hand is guiding,
And for all my wants providing—
In His precious love confiding,
I'll go with Him all the way.

c
Where my Saviour leads I'll follow,
Where my Saviour leads I'll follow,
Where my Saviour leads I'll follow—
I will follow all the way.

Though my path be dark and dreary,
And my steps be faint and weary—
With His loving voice to cheer me,
I'll go with Him all the way.

Though the ills of earth may wound me
And the storms of life confound me—
With His loving arms around me,
I'll go with Him all the way.

When the ties of earth shall sever,
And He calls me home for ever—
To the loved beyond the river,
I'll go with Him all the way.


545
O soul, tossed on the billows,

O soul, tossed on the billows,
Afar from friendly land,
Look up to Him who holds thee
In" the hollow of His hand."

c
In the hollow of His hand!
In the hollow of His hand!—
Oh, how safe are all who trust Him,
In the hollow of His hand!

Though raging winds may drive thee
A wreck upon the strand,
Still cling to Him who holds thee
In" the hollow of His hand."

When strength is spent in toiling,
And wearily you stand,
Then rest in Him who holds thee
In" the hollow of His hand."

When by the swelling Jordan,
Your feet in sinking sand,
Remember still He holds thee
In" the hollow of His hand."

And when at last we're gathered
With all the ransomed band,
We'll praise our God who holds us
In" the hollow of His hand."


546
Lead to the shadow of the Rock of

Lead to the shadow of the Rock of
Refuge my weary feet;
Give me the water from the life-stream flowing
Clear, pure, and sweet.

There from the billlows and tempest hiding,
Under the shelter of Thy love abiding,
Safe in the shadow of the" Rock of Ages"
Joy shall be mine!

Lead to the shadow of the Rock
Eternal my heart opprest;
There in the secret of Thy holy
presence, calm shall I rest.

Lead to the shadow of the" Rock of
Ages"; oh, keep Thou me
Safe from the arrows of the world's
temptations, close, close to Thee!


547
When the storms of life are raging,

When the storms of life are raging,
Tempests wild on sea and land,
I will seek a place of refuge
In the shadow of God's hand.

c
He will hide . me! . He will hide . me
Where no harm . . can e'er betide me:
He will hide . me I . safely hide . me, .
In the sha -- dow of His hand!

Though He may send some affliction,
'Twill but make me long for home;
For in love and not in anger,
All His chastenings will come.

Enemies may strive to injure,
Satan all his arts employ;
God will turn what seems to harm me
Into everlasting joy.

So, while here the cross I'm bearing,
Meeting storms and billows wild,
Jesus for my soul is caring,
Naught can harm His Father's child.


548
Thou knowest, Lord, Thou knowest all about me,

Thou knowest, Lord, Thou knowest all about me,
And all the winding way my feet have trod;
And now Thou know'st I cannot go without Thee,
To guide me onward through the swelling flood.

Thou know'st my way—how lone, how dark, how cheerless,
If Thy dear hand I fail in all to see:
Bright with Thy smile of love, my heart is fearless,
When in my weakness I can lean on Thee.

Give me Thy presence! Go Thou, Lord, before me,
Make a plain path where all is rough and drear;
So let me trust the love that watches o'er me,
And in the shadows still believe Thee near.


549
Saviour, hold me close to Thee,

Saviour, hold me close to Thee,
Kept by the power of God;
Only this my trust shall be,
Kept by the power of God.

c
Sweetly kept" in perfect peace, "
When from fears He gives release;
Kept" through faith" till time shall cease,
Kept by the power of God.

Kept from every evil thing,
Kept by the power of God;
Underneath His sheltering wing,
Kept by the power of God.

Kept till earthly perils past,
Kept by the power of God;
We shall overcome atlast,
Kept by the power of God.

Kept to sing His praise above,
Kept by the power of God;
Wondrous mercy, wondrous love,
Kept by the power of God.


550
Hold Thou my hand! so weak I am,

Hold Thou my hand! so weak I am, and helpless,
I dare not take one step without Thy aid;
Hold Thou my hand! for then, O loving Saviour,
No dread of ill shall make my soul afraid.

Hold Thou my hand! and closer,closer draw me
To Thy dear self—my hope, my joy, my all:
Hold Thou my hand, lest haply I should wander;
And, missing Thee, my trembling feet should fall.

Hold Thou my hand! the way is dark before me
Without the sunlight of Thy face divine;
But when by faith I catch its radiant glory,
What heights of joy, what rapturous songs are mine!

Hold Thou my hand! that when I reach the margin
Of that lone river Thou didst cross for me,
A heavenly light may flash along its waters,
And every wave like crystal bright shall be.


551
Firm as a rock, that in the mighty ocean

Firm as a rock, that in the mighty ocean
Hurls back the waves, and with majestic form,
Grand and sublime, amid their wild commotion
Heeds not the tempest nor the raging storm.

c
Firm as a rock! no power shall cleave asunder,
Though lightnings flash and thunders loudly roar;
So will we trust in Him, our great Redeemer—
Jesus, our hiding-place, for evermore!

Firm as a rock, that in the thirsty desert
Veils like a cloud the noontide's burning ray,
While with delight the worn and weary traveller
Turns to its shadow from his lonely way.

Firm as a rock, though surges dash around us!
Firm as a rock, though trials dark may fall!
Yet shall we cling to Him, the Rock of Ages,
Jesus, the Holy One, our All in All!

Firm as a rock, when earthly scenes are waning!
Firm as a rock, when Jordan's billows roll!
Firm as a rock, we'll rest upon His promise!
Jesus, the Refuge of the weary soul!


552
Lord Jesus, Thou dost keep Thy child

Lord Jesus, Thou dost keep Thy child [
Through sunshine or through tempests wild;
Jesus, I trust in Thee!
Thine is such wondrous power to save,
Thine is the mighty love that gave
Its all on Calvary.

O glorious Saviour! Thee I praise;
To Thee my new glad song I raise,
And tell of what Thou art.
Thy grace is boundless in its store;
Thy face of love shines evermore:
Thou givest me Thy heart.

Upon Thy promises I stand,
Trusting in Thee: Thine own right hand
Doth keep and comfort me!
My soul doth triumph in Thy Word;
Thine, Thine be all the praise, dear Lord,
As Thine the victory.

Love perfecteth what it begins:
Thy power doth save me from my sins—
Thy grace upholdeth me.
This life of trust—how glad, how sweet!
My need and Thy great fulness meet,
And I have all in Thee.


553
love divine, how sweet Thou art!

love divine, how sweet Thou art!
When shall I find my willing heart
All taken up by Thee?
I thirst, I faint, I die to prove
The greatness of redeeming love,
The love of Christ to me!

Stronger His love than death or hell;
Its riches are unsearchable:
The first-born sons of light
Desire in vain its depths to see;
They cannot reach the mystery,
The length, and breadth, and height.

God only knows the love of God;
Oh, that it now were shed abroad
In this poor stony heart:
For love I sigh, for love I pine:
This only portion, Lord, be mine,
Be mine this better part.

Oh, that I could for ever sit
With Mary at the Master's feet;
Be this my happy choice:
My only care, delight, and bliss,
My joy, my heaven on earth, be this,
To hear the Bridegroom's voice.


554
He feedeth His flock like a Shepherd,

He feedeth His flock like a Shepherd,
Where pastures are blooming and fair;
He gathers the lambs in His bosom,
And shelters them tenderly there.

c
He feed-eth His flock, ... His flock ... like a Shepherd,
And ga-thers the lambs, ... the lambs ... in His bosom;
He feed-eth His flock, ... His flock ... like a Shepherd,
And ga-thers the lambs, ... the lambs ... in His bosom.

He feedeth His flock like a Shepherd;
And when in the desert they roam,
He patiently follows their footsteps,
Arid leadeth them tenderly home.

He feedeth His flock like a Shepherd;
The weakest His kindness may claim;
He never will leave nor forsake them
Who trust in His excellent name.


555
When storms around are sweeping,

When storms around are sweeping,
When lone my watch I'm keeping,
'Mid fires of evil falling,
'Mid tempters' voices calling,

c
Remember me. O Mighty One!
Remember me, O Mighty One!

When walking on life's ocean,
Control its raging motion;
When from its dangers shrinking,
When in its dread deeps sinking,

When weight of sin oppresses,
When dark despair distresses,
AH through the life that's mortal,
And when I pass death's portal,


556
Jesus, Saviour, pilot me,

Jesus, Saviour, pilot me,
Over life's tempestuous sea;
Unknown waves before me roll,
Hiding rock and treacherous shoal;
Chart and compass come from Thee:
Jesus, Saviour, pilot me!

As a mother stills her child,
Thou canst hush the ocean wild;
Boisterous waves obey Thy will
When Thou say'st to them"Be still!"
Wondrous Sovereign of the sea,
Jesus, Saviour, pilot me!

When at last I near the shore,
And the fearful breakers roar
'Twixt me and the peaceful rest—
Then, while leaning on Thy breast,
May I hear Thee say to me,
"Fear not! I will pilot thee!"


557
In Thy cleft, O Rock of Ages, hide Thou me!

In Thy cleft, O Rock of Ages, hide Thou me!
When the fitful tempest rages, hide Thou me!
Where no mortal arm can sever
From my heart Thy love for ever,
Hide me, O Thou Rock of Ages,
Safe in Thee!

From the snare of sinful pleasure, hide Thou me!
Thou, my soul's eternal Treasure, hide Thou me!
When the world its power is wielding,
And my heart is almost yielding,
Hide me, O Thou Rock of Ages,
Safe in Thee!

In the lonely night of sorrow, hide Thou me!
Till in glory dawns the morrow, hide Thou me!
When I'm nearing Jordan's billow,
Let Thy bosom be my pillow;
Hide me, O Thou Rock of Ages,
Safe in Thee!


558
My soul at last a rest hath found,

My soul at last a rest hath found,
A rest that will not fail;
A sure and certain anchorage ground
In Christ within the vail.

O Rock ... of Ages, cleft for me,
In Thee ... my soul securely hide!
My tower of strength, I fly to Thee,
And safely there abide.

I'll hide me in this refuge strong,
From every stormy blast;
And sit and sing until the waves
Of wrath are overpast.

Ye comfortless and tempest-tost,
By sins and woes opprest:
Ye tempted, troubled, ruined, lost,
Come find in Christ your rest!

Ye thirsty, from this smitten Rock
Life's crystal water spring;
There hide from every stormy shock,
And rest, and drink, and sing!


559
The Lord is my Refuge, my Strength and Shield,

The Lord is my Refuge, my Strength and Shield,
And this of a truth I know;
His tender protection is o'er me still,
My comfort where'er I go.

c
Though bright with the joys that no tongue can tell,
Eternity's years may be;
Oh, never, no, never, can I forget
His wonderful love to me!

The Lord is my Refuge, my Strength, and Shield,
All glory to Him I'll give;
And sing of His mercy by night and day,
For only in Him I live.

The Lord is my Refuge, my Strength, and Shield,
My Saviour, my Friend, and Guide!
He makes me a child and an heir of grace:
Oh, what can I ask beside?

Blessed is he that is trusting the Lord,

Blessed is he that is trusting the Lord,
For the help that he daily needs;
He shall inherit the promised reward,
If he follow where Jesus leads.

c
Trust ... in the Lord with all ... thine heart, ...
And in all thy ways acknowledge Him, ...
And He shall direct thy paths; ...
Trust ... in the Lord ... with all ... thine heart, . .
And in all thy ways acknowledge Him, ...
And He shall direct thy paths.

Blessed is he that is trusting the Lord,
Who doth follow the heavenly way;
Keeping with patience and hope the path,
All his steps shall be guarded each day.

Blessed is he whom the Father will aid,
And the Saviour will e'er befriend;
He shall not fear, and shall not be dismayed,
For the Lord will his soul defend.

Blessed is he who will keep in the way
That will upward and onward lead;
Walking by faith in His love every day,
Who supplieth his daily need.


561
Give to the winds thy fears;

Give to the winds thy fears;
Hope, and be undismayed:
God hears thy sighs, and counts thy tears;
God shall lift up thy head.

Through waves, and clouds, and storms,
He gently clears thy way;
Wait thou His time; so shall the night
Soon end in joyous day.

He everywhere hath sway,
And all things serve His might;
His every act pure blessing is,
His path unsullied light.

When He makes bare His arm,
What shall His work withstand?
When He His people's cause defends,
Who, who shall stay His hand?

Leave to His sovereign sway
To choose and to command;
With wonder filled thou then shalt own
How wise, how strong His hand.

Thou comprehend'st Him not;
Yet earth and heaven tell,
God sits as Sovereign on His throne—
He ruleth all things well.

Thou seest our weakness, Lord,
Our hearts are known to Thee:
Oh, lift Thou up the sinking hand,
Confirm the feeble knee!

Let us, in life and death,
Thy steadfast truth declare;
And publish, with our latest breath,
Thy love and guardian care.


562
The Lord's my Shepherd, I'll not want:

The Lord's my Shepherd, I'll not want:
He makes me down to lie
In pastures green; He leadeth me
The quiet waters by.

My soul He doth restore again;
And me to walk doth make
Within the paths of righteousness,
Ev'n for His own name's sake.

Yea, though I walk in death's dark
Yet will I fear none ill;
For Thou art with me; and Thy rod vale,
And staff me comfort still.

My table Thou hast furnished
In presence of my foes;
My head Thou dost with oil anoint,
And my cup overflows.

Goodness and mercy all my life
Shall surely follow me;
And in God's house for evermore
My dwelling-place shall be.


563
Trust God as a child of His love,

Trust God as a child of His love,
Trust in Him to guide you with His eye;
Trust God for the blessings of life,
For these He will supply.

c
Trust God, as He has told you, and
look to Him from day to day;
Put your trust in God, as
the Guardian of your way.

Trust God when the tempter is near,
Trust in Him for grace to turn aside;
Trust God 'mid the billows of life.
A refuge to provide.

Trust God at the coming of grief,
Trust in Him to soothe its bitter pain;
Trust God 'mid the burdens of life,
To strengthen and sustain.

Trust God as you journey along,
Trust in Him for grace to win the prize;
Trust God till you answer the call
To meet Him in the skies.


564
I know not what awaits me;

I know not what awaits me;
God kindly veils mine eyes,
And o'er each step of my onward way
He makes new scenes to rise;
And every joy He sends me comes
A sweet and glad surprise.

c
Where He may lead I'll follow,
My trust in Him repose:
And every hour in perfect peace
I'll sing, "He knows! He knows!"

One step I see before me;
'Tis all I need to see:
The light of heaven more brightly shines,
When earth's illusions flee;
And sweetly thro' the silence comes
His loving, "Follow Me."

Oh, blissful lack of wisdom!
'Tis blessed not to know;
He holds me with His own right hand,
And will not let me go;
And lulls my troubled soul to rest
In Him who loves me so.

So on I go—not knowing,
I would not if I might;
I'd rather walk in the dark with God
Than go alone in the light;
I'd rather walk by faith with Him
Than go alone by sight.


565
I am sailing afar on the ocean of life,

I am sailing afar on the ocean of life,
In my bark that is slender and frail;
But I know not a fear with my Pilot to steer,
And in safety I meet every gale.

c
Jesus is my Pilot,
The Pilot of my soul;
I will ever trust Him,
Though surging billows roll.

I am tossed on the waves, to the deeps I am borne,
But my Pilot is strong at the helm;
In His love I abide, in His promise confide,
And the wild waters never o'er whelm.

When the harbour appears, and my voyage is done,
And the storms never come to me more;
Oh, what joy it will be all my loved ones to see,
When we meet on eternity's shore.


566
Amid the trials that I meet,

Amid the trials that I meet,
Amid the thorns that pierce my feet,
One thought remains supremely sweet—
Thou thinkest, Lord, of me!

c
Thou thinkest, Lord, of me! ...
Thou thinkest, Lord, of me! ...
What need I fear when Thou art near,
And thinkest, Lord, of me?

The cares of life come thronging fast,
Upon my soul their shadows cast;
Their gloom reminds my heart at last—
Thou thinkest, Lord, of me!

Let shadows come, let shadows go,
Let life be bright, or dark with woe,
I am content; for this I know—
Thou thinkest, Lord, of me!


567

Trusting in Thee, trusting in Thee;

While I am trusting in Thee!

c
Trust - ing, ... trust - ing, ...
Jesus, my Saviour, in Thee; ....
Oh, what a foretaste of glory is mine,
While I am trusting in Thee!

What though around me the billows may roll?
Trusting in Thee, trusting in Thee;
Firm on the Rock I have anchored my soul;
Lord, I am trusting in Thee!

What if the shadows encompass my way?
Trusting in Thee, trusting in Thee;
Lord, Thou hast promised Thy strength as my day,
While I am trusting in Thee.

Jesus, my Shepherd, Redeemer, and Friend,
Trusting in Thee, trusting in Thee;
Thou wilt deliver, and Thou wilt defend,
While I am trusting in Thee.

Precious thought—my Father knoweth!

Precious thought—my Father knoweth!
In His love I rest;
For whate'er my Father doeth
Must be always best;
Well I know the heart that planneth
Naught but good for me;
Joy and sorrow interwoven,
Love in all I see.

Precious thought—my Father knoweth!
Careth for His child;
Bids me nestle closer to Him,
When the storms beat wild;
Though my earthly hopes are shattered,
And the teardrops fall,
Yet He is Himself my solace,
Yea, my" all in all."

Oh to trust Him then more fully!
Just to simply move
In the conscious calm enjoyment
Of the Father's love;
Knowing that life's chequered pathway
Leadeth to His rest;
Satisfied the way He taketh
Must be always best.

Lord Jesus, I long to be perfectly whole,

Lord Jesus, I long to be perfectly whole,
I want Thee for ever to live in my soul;
Break down every idol, cast out every foe—
Now wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.

c
Whiter than snow, yes, whiter than snow,
Now wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.

Lord Jesus, let nothing unholy remain,
Apply Thine own blood and extract every stain;
To get this blest cleansing I all things forego—
Now wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.

Lord Jesus, look down from Thy throne in the skies,
And help me to make a complete sacrifice;
I give up myself and whatever I know—
Now wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.

Lord Jesus, for this I most humbly entreat;
I wait, blessed Lord, at Thy crucified feet;
By faith, for my cleansing, I see Thy blood flow—
Now wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.

Lord Jesus, Thou seest I patiently wait;
Come now, and within me a new heart create;
To those who have sought Thee, Thou never saidst No—
Now wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.


570
Saviour, more than life to me,

Saviour, more than life to me,
I am clinging, clinging close to Thee;
Let Thy precious blood, applied,
Keep me ever, ever near Thy side.

c
Every day, . . every hour, . .
Let me feel Thy cleansing power;
May Thy tender love to me
Bind me closer, closer, Lord, to Thee.

Through this changing world below.
Lead me gently, gently as I go;
Trusting Thee, I cannot stray,
I can never, never lose my way.

Let me love Thee more and more,
Till this fleeting, fleeting life is o'er;
Till my soul is lost in love,
In a brighter, brighter world above.


571
More about Jesus would I know,

More about Jesus would I know,
More of His grace to others show;
More of His saving fulness see,
More of His love—who died for me.

c
More, more about Jesus,
More, more about Jesus;
More of His saving fulness see,
More of His love who died for me.

More about Jesus let me learn,
More of His holy will discern;
Spirit of God, my teacher be,
Showing the things of Christ to me.

More about Jesus; in His Word
Holding communion with my Lord;
Hearing His voice in every line,
Making each faithful saying mine.

More about Jesus, on His throne,
Riches in glory all His own;
More of His kingdom's sure increase;
More of His coming—Prince of Peace.

Fountain of purity opened for sin,

Fountain of purity opened for sin,
Here may the penitent wash and be clean;
Jesus, Thou blessed Redeemer from woe,
Wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.

c
Whiter than snow, ... whiter than snow; ...
Wash me, Redeem-er, and I shall be whiter than snow.

Though I have laboured again and again,
All my self-cleansing is utterly vain;
Jesus, Redeemer from sorrow and woe,
Wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.

Cleanse Thou the thoughts of my heart, I implore;
Help me Thy light to reflect more and more;
Daily in loving obedience to grow,
Wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.

Whiter than snow! nothing farther I need;
Christ is the Fountain: this only I plead;
Jesus, my Saviour, to Thee will I go—
Wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.


573
Show me Thy face—one transient gleam

Show me Thy face—one transient gleam
Of loveliness Divine,
And I shall never think or dream
Of other Jove save Thine:
All lesser light will darken quite,
All lower glories wane,
The beautiful of earth will scarce
Seem beautiful again.

Show me Thy face—my faith and love
Shall henceforth fixed be
And nothing here have power to move
My soul's serenity.
My life shall seem a trance, a dream,
And all I feel and see,
Illusive, visionary—Thou
The one reality!

Show me Thy face—I shall forget
The weary days of yore,
The fretting ghosts of vain regret
Shall haunt my soul no more.
All doubts and fears for future years
In quiet rest subside,
And naught but blest content and calm
Within my breast reside.


Show me Thy face—the heaviest cross
Will then seem light to bear,
There will be gain in every loss,
And peace with every care.
With such light feet the years will fleet,
Life seem as brief as blest,
Till I have laid my burden down,
And entered into rest.


574
Thou my everlasting Portion,

Thou my everlasting Portion,
More than friend or life to me,
All along my pilgrim journey,
Saviour, let me walk with Thee.

c
Close to Thee, close to Thee,
Close to Thee, close to Thee,
All along my pilgrim journey,
Saviour, let me walk with Thee.

Not for ease or worldly pleasure,
Not for fame my prayer shall be;
Gladly will I toil and suffer,
Only let me walk with Thee.

c
Gladly will I toil and suffer,
Only let me walk with Thee.

Lead me through the vale of shadows,
Bear me o'er life's fitful sea;
Then the gate of life eternal
May I enter, Lord, with Thee.

c
Then the gate of life eternal
May I enter, Lord, with Thee.

Soul of mine, in earthly temple

Soul of mine, in earthly temple
Why not here content abide?
Why art thou for ever pleading?
Why art thou not satisfied?

c
I . . . shall be satisfied,
I . . . shall be satisfied,
When I awake in His likeness.

Soul of mine, my heart is clinging
To the earth's fair pomp and pride;
Ah, why dost thou thus reprove me?
Why art thou not satisfied?

Soul of mine, must I surrender,
See myself as crucified,
Turn from all of earth's ambition,
That thou may'st be satisfied?

Soul of mine, continue pleading;
Sin rebuke, and folly chide:
I accept the cross of Jesus,
That thou may'st be satisfied.


576
I want the adorning Divine,

I want the adorning Divine,
Thou only, my God, canst bestow;
I want in those beautiful garments to shine,
Which distinguish Thy household below.
I want every moment to feel
That Thy Spirit resides in my heart,
That His power is present to cleanse and to heal,
And newness of life to impart.

I want, oh, I want to attain
Some likeness, my Saviour, to Thee!
That longed-for resemblance once more to regain—
Thy comeliness put upon me!
I want to be marked for Thine own,
Thy seal on my forehead to wear;
To receive that" new name" on the mystic white stone,
Which none but Thyself can declare.

I want as a traveller to haste
Straight onward, nor pause on my way;
Nor forethought, nor anxious contrivance to waste
On the tent only pitched for a day.
I want, and this sums up my prayer,
To glorify Thee till I die;
Then calmly to yield up my soul to Thy care,
And breathe out, in faith, my last sigh.


577
I need Thee every hour,

I need Thee every hour,
Most gracious Lord;
No tender voice like Thine
Can peace afford.

c
I need Thee, oh, I need Thee;
Every hour I need Thee;
Oh, bless me now, my Saviour!
I come to Thee.

I need Thee every hour,
Stay Thou near by;
Temptations lose their power
When Thou art nigh.

I need Thee every hour,
In joy or pain;
Come quickly and abide,
Or life is vain.

I need Thee every hour;
Teach me Thy will;
And Thy rich promises
In me fulfil.

I need Thee every hour,
Most Holy One:
Oh, make me Thine indeed,
Thou blessed Son.


578
I would have the Saviour with me,

I would have the Saviour with me,
For I dare not walk alone;
I would feel His presence near me,
And His arm around me thrown.

c
Then my soul ... shall fear no ill, ...
While He leads ... me where He will, ...
I will go ... without a murmur,
And His footsteps follow still.

I would have the Saviour with me,
For my faith, at best, is weak;
He can whisper words of comfort
That no other voice can speak.

I would have the Saviour with me
In the onward march of life,
Through the tempest and the sunshine,
Through the battle and the strife.

I would have the Saviour with me,
That His eye the way may guide,
Till I reach the vale of Jordan,
Till I cross the rolling tide.


579
Thou whose hand thus far hath led me,

Thou whose hand thus far hath led me,
Wheresoe'er my path may be;
Lord, I pray that Thou wilt ever
Draw, and keep me near to Thee.

c
Near to Thee, O Lord, to Thee—
Draw me ever near to Thee.

When the way is dark and cheerless,
When no ray of light I see,
May Thine arms of love and mercy
Draw me ever near to Thee.

Thou in whom my soul is trusting,
Hope of life and joy to me;
While on earth a pilgrim stranger,
Draw me ever near to Thee.


580
Nearer, blessed Jesus, to Thy wounded side;

Nearer, blessed Jesus, to Thy wounded side;
Nearer to Thy heart of love, would my soul abide;
There alone is safety, there alone is rest,
When beset with danger, when with guilt opprest.

Purer, Saviour, purer, may I ever be,
Free from every earthly stain, more, O Lord, like Thee;
Listening 'mid the tempest for Thy" Peace, be still!"
Trusting when in darkness, resting in Thy will.

Watching, ever watching, even unto prayer;
Leaving all with Jesus, yielding every care;
Trusting, fully trusting, every promise sweet;
Learning life's great lesson at Thy precious feet.

Waiting, only waiting, till the hour shall come,
When with joy I'll meet Him there, in the heavenly home;
Oh for that glad morning, when my Lord again,
"Glorified in all His saints, "comes with them to reign!


581
Nearer, my God, to Thee,Nearer to Thee;

Nearer, my God, to Thee,
Nearer to Thee;
E'en though it be a cross
That raiseth me,
Still all my song shall be-
Nearer, my God, to Thee!
Nearer to Thee!

Though, like the wanderer,
The sun gone down,
Darkness be over me,
My rest a stone,
Yet in my dreams I'd be
Nearer, my God, to Thee!
Nearer to Thee!

There let the way appear
Steps unto heaven;
All that Thou sendest me
In mercy given:
Angels to beckon me
Nearer, my God, to Thee!
Nearer to Thee!

Then with my waking thoughts
Bright with Thy praise,
Out of my stony griefs
Bethel I'll raise:
So by my woes to be
Nearer, my God, to Thee!
Nearer to Thee!

Or if on joyful wing
Cleaving the sky,
Sun, moon, and stars forgot,
Upward I fly,
Still all my song shall be—
Nearer, my God, to Thee!
Nearer to Thee!


582
More holiness give me, more strivings within;

More holiness give me, more strivings within;
More patience in suffering, more sorrow for sin;
More faith in my Saviour, more
sense of His care;
More joy in His service, more purpose in prayer.

More gratitude give me, more trust in the Lord;
More zeal for His glory, more hope in His Word;
More tears for His sorrows, more pain at His grief;
More meekness in trial, more praise for relief.

More purity give me, more strength to o'ercome;
More freedom from earth-stains, more longings for home;
More fit for the kingdom, more used would I be;
More blessed and holy, more, Saviour, like Thee.


583
Oh for a closer walk with God,

Oh for a closer walk with God,
A calm and heavenly frame;
A light to shine upon the road
That leads me to the Lamb!

Where is the blessedness I knew
When first I saw the Lord?
Where is the soul-refreshing view
Of Jesus and His word?

What peaceful hours I once enjoyed-
How sweet their memory still!
But they have left an aching void
The world can never fill.

The dearest idol I have known,
Whate'er that idol be,
Help me to tear it from Thy throne,
And worship only Thee.

So shall my walk be close with God,
Calm and serene my frame;
So purer light shall mark the road
That leads me to the Lamb.


584
Come, let us to the Lord our God

Come, let us to the Lord our God
With contrite hearts return;
Our God is gracious, nor will leave
The desolate to mourn.

His voice commands the tempest forth,
And stills the stormy wave;
And though His arm be strong to smite,
'Tis also strong to save.

Long hath the night of sorrow reigned;
The dawn shall bring us light;
God shall appear, and we shall rise
With gladness in His sight.

Our hearts, if God we seek to know,
Shall know Him and rejoice;
His coming like the morn shall be,
Like morning songs His voice.

As dew upon the tender herb,
Diffusing fragrance round;
As showers that usher in the spring,
And cheer the thirsty ground:

So shall His presence bless our souls,
And shed a joyful light;
That hallowed morn shall chase away
The sorrows of the night.


585
Jesus Christ, grow Thou in me,

Jesus Christ, grow Thou in me,
And all things else recede!
My heart be daily nearer Thee,
From sin be daily freed.

Each day let Thy supporting might
My weakness still embrace;
My darkness vanish in Thy light,
Thy life my death efface.

In Thy bright beams which on me fall
Fade every evil thought;
That I am nothing, Thou art all,
I would be daily taught.

More of Thy glory let me see,
Thou Holy, Wise, and True!
I would Thy living image be,
In joy and sorrow too.

Fill me with gladness from above,
Hold me by strength Divine:
Lord, let the glow of Thy great love
Through my whole being shine.

Make this poor self grow less and less,
Be Thou my life and aim;
Oh, make me daily through Thy grace
More meet to bear Thy name!


586
Oh, suffer me to come to Thee,

Oh, suffer me to come to Thee,
Jesus, the Son;
Oh, may my heart from evil part
To Thee be won.

Thy blessing give; help me to live,
Jesus, for Thee;
Nor let me stray from Thee away,
But strengthen me.

Safe in the arms that guard from harms,
Jesus, my Guide,
Protect me still, keep me from ill,
Close to Thy side.

So strong Thou art, control my heart,
Jesus, most kind;
Oh, make me true, my soul renew,
To Thee it bind.

When ends my life from care and strife,
Jesus, with Thee,
In heavenly peace, where sin doth cease,
At home I'll be.


587
Search me, O God, my actions try,

Search me, O God, my actions try,
And let my life appear
As seen by Thine all-searching eye:
To mine my ways make clear.

Search all my sense, and know my heart,
Who only canst make known;
And let the deep, the hidden part
To me be fully shown.

Throw light into the darkened cells,
Where passion reigns within;
Quicken my conscience till it feels
The loathsomeness of sin.

Search all my thoughts, the secret springs,
The motives that control;
The chambers where polluted things
Hold empire o'er the soul.

Search, till Thy fiery glance has cast
Its holy light through all,
And I by grace am brought at last
Before Thy face to fall.

Thus prostrate I shall learn of Thee
What now I feebly prove—
That God alone in Christ can be
Unutterable love!


588
Holy Father! hear my cry;

Holy Father! hear my cry;
Holy Saviour! bend Thine ear;
Holy Spirit! come Thou nigh;—
Father, Saviour, Spirit, hear!

Father, save me from my sin;
Saviour, I Thy mercy crave;
Gracious Spirit, make me clean;—
Father, Son, and Spirit, save!

Father, let me taste Thy love;
Saviour, fill my soul with peace;
Spirit, come, my heart to move:
Father, Son, and Spirit bless!

Father, Son, and Spirit, Thou
One Jehovah, shed abroad
All Thy grace within me now—
Be my Father and my God!


589
My Saviour, Thou hast offered rest:

My Saviour, Thou hast offered rest:
Oh, give it, then, to me!—
The rest of ceasing from myself,
To find my all in Thee.

This cruel self, oh, how it strives
And works within my breast,
To come between Thee and my soul
And keep me back from rest!

How many subtle forms it takes
Of seeming verity,
As if it were not safe to rest,
And venture all on Thee.

O Lord, I seek a holy rest,
A victory over sin! I seek that
Thou alone shouldst reign
O'er all without, within.

In Thy strong hand I lay me down—
So shall the work be done:
For who can work so wondrously
As the Almighty One?

Work on, then, Lord, till on my soul
Eternal light shall break;
And, in Thy likeness perfected,
I" satisfied" shall wake.


590
I have given up all for Jesus—

I have given up all for Jesus—
This vain world is naught to me;
All its pleasures are forgotten
In remembering Calvary.
Though my friends despise, forsake me,
And on me the world looks cold,
I've a Friend that will stand by me
When the pearly gates unfold.

c
Life's morn will soon be waning,
And its evening bells be tolled,
But my heart will know no sadness
When the pearly gates unfold.

When the voice of Jesus calls me,
And the angels whisper low,
I will lean upon my Saviour
Through the valley as I go:
I will claim His precious promise,
Worth to me the world of gold:
"Fear no evil, I'll be with thee
When the pearly gates unfold."

Just beyond the waves of Jordan,
Just beyond its chilling tide,
Blooms the Tree of Life immortal,
And the living waters glide:
In that happy land of spirits
Are there stores of bliss untold,
And the angels are awaiting
Where the pearly gates unfold.


591
My glorious Victor, Prince Divine,

My glorious Victor, Prince Divine,
Clasp these surrendered hands in Thine;
At length my will is all Thine own,
Glad vassal of a Saviour's throne.

My Master, lead me to Thy door;
Pierce this now willing ear once more;
Thy bonds are freedom; let me stay
With Thee, to toil, endure, obey.

Yes, ear and hand, and thought and will,
Use all in Thy dear slavery still!
Self's weary liberties I cast
Beneath Thy feet; there keep them fast.

Tread them still down; and then I know,
These hands shall with Thy gifts o'erflow;
And pierced ears shall hear the tone
Which tells me Thou and I are one.


592
"Not my own!" but saved by Jesus,

"Not my own!" but saved by Jesus,
Who redeemed me by His blood:
Gladly I accept the message,
I belong to Christ the Lord!

c
"Not my own!" . . Oh, "not my own!" . .
Jesus, I . . belong to Thee! . .
All I have, and all I hope for,
Thine for all eternity!

"Not my own!" to Christ, my Saviour,
I, believing, trust my soul;
Everything to Him committed,
While eternal ages roll,
"Not my own!" my time, my talent,
Freely all to Christ I bring,
To be used in joyful service
For the glory of my King.

"Not my own!" The Lord accepts me.
One among the ransomed throng,
Who in heaven shall see His glory,
And to Jesus Christ belong.


593
Once it was the blessing, now it is the Lord;

Once it was the blessing, now it is the Lord;
Once it was the feeling, now it is His Word;
Once His gifts I wanted, now the Giver own;
Once I sought for healing, now Him self alone.

c
All in all for ever, Jesus will I sing;
Everything in Jesus, and Jesus everything.

Once 'twas painful trying, now 'tis perfect trust;
Once a half salvation, now the uttermost;
Once 'twas ceaseless holding, now He holds me fast;
Once 'twas constant drifting, now my anchor's cast.

Once 'twas busy planning, now 'tis trustful prayer;
Once 'twas anxious caring, now He has the care;
Once 'twas what I wanted, now what Jesus says;
Once 'twas constant asking, now 'tis ceaseless praise.

Once it was my working, His it hence shall be;
Once I tried to use Him, now He uses me;
Once the power I wanted, now the Mighty One;
Once for self I laboured, now for Him alone.

Once I hoped in Jesus, now I know He's mine;
Once my lamps were dying, now they brightly shine;
Once for death I waited, now His coming hail;
And my hopes are anchored safe within the veil.


594
I am glad I have heard of the Saviour's great mercy!

I am glad I have heard of the Saviour's great mercy!
And that now I am singing His redemption's new song;
And e'er since, by His grace, unto Him I surrendered,
In my heart has been ringing—" I believe! I belong!"

c
Tell it out! tell it out! Christ the theme of my story!
Sing, ye mountains and hills! breezes, waft it along!
Praise the Lord! He provideth a perfect salvation;
So we'll take as our watchword—" I believe I belong! '

Once the slave of my sin, then my soul lay in darkness,
Kept a prisoner by Satan in his dungeon so strong;
But the Lord, by His power, set me free from my bondage,
And He gave me this watchword—" I believe! I belong!"

I believe for a full and a perfect salvation;
I belong to my Saviour with a love deep and strong;
And though oft sorely tempted to change my allegiance,
Still my faith gives the answer—" I believe! I belong!"

But I look for the time when, my journey safe ended,
I shall join in the chorus of the heavenly throng:
Oh, what rapture 'twill be on the throne to behold Him,
To eternity singing—" I believe! I belong!"


595
Thy will, O Lord, not mine, Teach me to say;

Thy will, O Lord, not mine,
Teach me to say;
Not my will, Lord, but Thine,
I would obey;
Then shall I know the joy,
And Thy name glorify,
When I, on earth, shall try
To follow Thee.

My weakness, Lord, I own,
From day to day;
I listen for Thy voice
To lead the way;
Oh, wilt Thou send the light
To make my pathway bright,
And show me what is right,
The only way.

I cannot see just where
The Spirit leads,
But know that Christ is there,
Who intercedes;
Oh, help me now to rest
On Jesus' loving breast,
Till He shall manifest
His love in me!


596
Anywhere, my Saviour, lead my willing feet,

Anywhere, my Saviour, lead my willing feet,
Only let me clasp Thy hand, feel Thy presence sweet;
Thorns may pierce and snares beset,
I will follow Thee
Anywhere, my Saviour, if Thou leadest me.

c
Any-where, my blessed Saviour,
I will follow Thee, I will follow Thee;
Any-where, my blessed Saviour,
If Thou Ieadest me. . . .

Anywhere, my Saviour, only on me smile;
Strengthen, guard, and comfort me,
let not sin beguile;
Dark and toilsome though my way,
I will never fear,
Anywhere, my Saviour, if Thy presence cheer.

Anywhere, my Saviour: only this I pray,
Keep me in the narrow path, never let me stray;
Sin may plead with siren voice, help me answer, Nay,
Kept by Thee, my Saviour, I will hold my way.


597
Jesus, I my cross have taken,

Jesus, I my cross have taken,
All to leave and follow Thee;
Naked, poor, despised, forsaken,
Thou, from hence, my all shalt be.
Perish every fond ambition,
All I've sought, or hoped, or known,
Yet how rich is my condition!
God and heaven are still my own.

Let the world despise and leave me,
They have left my Saviour too;
Human hearts and looks deceive me;
Thou art not, like them, untrue.
And while Thou shalt smile upon me,
God of wisdom, love, and might,
Foes may hate, and friends may scorn me;
Show Thy face, and all is bright.

Man may trouble and distress me,
'Twill but drive me to Thy breast;
Life with trials hard may press me,
Heaven will bring me sweeter rest.
Oh, 'tis not in grief to harm me,
While Thy love is left to me:
Oh, 'twere not in joy to charm me,
Were that joy unblest by Thee!


598
It may not be on the mountain's height,

It may not be on the mountain's height,
Or over the stormy sea;
It may not be at the battle's front
My Lord will have need of me;
But if by a still small voice He calls
To paths which I do not know,
I'll answer, O Lord, with my hand in Thine,
I'll go where Thou wouldst I should go.

c
I'll go where Thou wouldst I should go, dear Lord,
Over mountain, or plain, or sea;
I'll say what Thou wouldst I should say, dear Lord,
I'll be what Thou wouldst I should be.

Perhaps to-day there are loving words
Which Jesus would have me speak;
There may be now in the paths of sin
Some wanderer whom I should seek;
O Saviour, if Thou wilt be my guide,
Though dark and rugged the way,
My voice shall echo Thy message sweet—
I'll say what thou wouldst I should say.

There must be still some lowly place
For me in the harvest wide,
Where I may labour through life's short day
For Jesus the crucified:
So, trusting my all to Thy tender care,
And knowing Thou lovest me,
I'll do Thy will with a heart sincere—
I'll be what Thou wouldst I should be.


599
O blessed life! the heart at rest,

O blessed life! the heart at rest,
When all without tumultuous seems,
That trusts a higher will, and deems
That higher will, not mine, the best.

O blessed life! the mind that sees
Whatever change the years may bring;
A mercy still in everything,
And shining through all mysteries.

O blessed life! the soul that soars,
When sense of mortal sight is dim,
Beyond the sense—beyond to Him
Whose love unlocks the heavenly doors.

O blessdd life! heart, mind, and soul,
From self-born aims and wishes free
In all—at one with Deity,
And loyal to the Lord's control.

O life! how blessed, how divine!
High life, the earnest of a higher!
Saviour, fulfil my deep desire,
And let this blessed life be mine.


600
Search me, O Lord! and try this heart of mine;

Search me, O Lord! and try this heart of mine;
Search me, and prove if I indeed am Thine:
Test by Thy word, that never changed can be,
My strength of hope and living faith in Thee.

Search me, O Lord! subdue each vain desire,
And in my soul a deeper love inspire;
Hide Thou my life, that I, supremely blest,
Beneath Thy wings in perfect peace may rest.

Search me, O Lord! and from the dross of sin,
Refine as gold, and keep me pure within;
Search Thou my thoughts, whose
springs Thine eyes can see:
From secret faults, O Saviour, cleanse; Thou me!

Search me, O Lord! let faith thro' grace divine
Thyself reflect in every act of mine,
Till at Thy call my waiting soul shall rise,
Caught up with joy to meet Thee in the skies.


601
All to Jesus I surrender,All to Him I freely give;

All to Jesus I surrender,
All to Him I freely give;
I will ever love and trust Him,
In His presence daily live.

c
I surrender all, ... I surrender all! ...
All to Thee, my blessed Saviour, I surrender all.

All to Jesus I surrender,
Humbly at His feet I bow;
Worldly pleasures all forsaken—
Take me, Jesus, take me now.

All to Jesus I surrender,
Make me, Saviour, wholly Thine;
Let the Holy Spirit witness
I am Thine and Thou art mine.

All to Jesus I surrender:
Lord, I give myself to Thee;
Fill me with Thy love and power,
Let Thy blessing rest on me.

All to Jesus I surrender:
Now I feel the sacred flame;
Oh the joy of full salvation!
Glory, glory to His name!


602
True-hearted, whole-hearted, faithful and loyal,

True-hearted, whole-hearted, faithful and loyal,
King of our lives by Thy grace we will be!
Under the standard exalted and royal,
Strong in Thy strength we will battle for Thee.

c
Peal out the watchword! silence it never!
Song of our spirits rejoicing and free;
Peal out the watchword! loyal for ever,
King of our lives, by Thy grace we will be!

True-hearted, whole-hearted, fullest allegiance
Yielding henceforth to our glorious King;
Valiant endeavour and loving obedience,
Freely and joyously now would we bring.

True-hearted, whole-hearted, Saviour all-glorious!
Take Thy great power, and reign there alone,
Over our wills and affections victorious,
Freely surrendered and wholly Thine own.


603
I am Thine own; O Christ! hence forth entirely Thine;

I am Thine own; O Christ! hence forth entirely Thine;
And life from this glad hour, new life, is mine.

No earthly joy can lure my quiet soul from Thee;
This deep delight, so pure, is heaven to me.

My joyful song of praise in sweet content I sing;
To Thee the note I raise, my King! my King!

I cannot tell the art by which such bliss is given;
I know Thou hast my heart, and I have heaven.

O peace—O holy rest, O balmy breath of love!
heart, divinest, best—Thy depth I prove!

I ask this gift of Thee—a life all lily fair,
And fragrant as the place where seraphs are.


604
I love Thee, Lord; yet 'tis no love of mine

I love Thee, Lord; yet 'tis no love of mine
That goeth forth to that great heart of Thine:
'Tis Thine own love which Thou hast given me
Returning back, O loving Lord, to Thee.

c
Oh! help me, Lord, to take, by grace divine,
Yet more and more of that great love of Thine;
That day by day my heart may give to Thee
A deeper love and growing constantly.

The earth absorbs the soft, refreshing rain,
And sends it back in flowers and fruits again;
So I receive Thy love so rich and free,
And send it back in joy and praise to Thee.

The moon receives the sun's bright, golden light,
And gives it forth to cheer the darksome night,
So I receive the rays of love divine,
And with them cheer this weary world of Thine.

'Tis by Thy love that I can love and bless
The foes who seek to blast my happiness;
Can e'en rejoice, when bearing wrong and shame,
Thou deem'st me meet to suffer for Thy name.

5 Naught but Thy love can satisfy my heart, [
Constrain my will from self and sin to part;
In love so great Thou giv'st Thyself to me;
For Thou art Love—to all eternity.


605
Arise and follow Me! Alas, my Lord,

Arise and follow Me!
Alas, my Lord, I hear Thy word,
But Thee Thyself I can but dimly see;
Help me to rise and follow Thee.

Arise and follow Me!
But I am bound to earth's cold ground
By many a tie: Come, Lord, and set me free,
Then I shall rise and follow Thee.

Arise and follow Me!
The way is rough, but 'tis enough
That through my life Thou wilt my Leader be;
And I will boldly follow Thee.

Arise and follow Me!
In mist and gloom, through tears and tomb,
Up golden streets and by the crystal sea,
I shall for ever follow Thee.


606
Jesus, I have promised To serve Thee

Jesus, I have promised
To serve Thee to the end;
Be Thou for ever near me,
My Master and my Friend!
I shall not fear the battle,
If Thou art by my side;
Nor wander from the pathway,
If Thou wilt be my Guide.

Oh, let me feel Thee near me,
The world is ever near;
I see the sights that dazzle,
The tempting sounds I hear:
My foes are ever near me,
Around me and within;
But, Jesus, draw Thou nearer,
And shield my soul from sin.

Oh, let me hear Thee speaking,
In accents clear and still,
Above the storms of passion,
The murmurs of self-will.
Oh speak, to reassure me,
To hasten or control;
Oh speak, and make me listen,
Thou Guardian of my soul!

O Jesus, Thou hast promised
To all who follow Thee,
That where Thou art in glory
There shall Thy servant be!
And, Jesus, I have promised
To serve Thee to the end;
Oh, give me grace to follow
My Master and my Friend!

Oh, let me see Thy footmarks,
And in them plant mine own;
My hope to follow duly
Is in Thy strength alone.
Oh, guide me, call me, draw me,
Uphold me to the end;
And then in heaven receive me,
My Saviour and my Friend!


607
I am Thine, O Lord, I have heard Thy voice,

I am Thine, O Lord, I have heard Thy voice,
And it told Thy love to me;
But I long to rise in the arms of faith,
And be closer drawn to Thee.

c
Draw me near er, nearer, blessed Lord,
To the cross where Thou hast died;
Draw me nearer, nearer, nearer, blessed Lord,
To Thy precious, bleeding side.

Consecrate me now to Thy service,Lord,
By the power of grace divine;
Let my soul look up with a steadfast hope,
And my will be lost in Thine.

Oh, the pure delight of a single hour
That before Thy throne I spend,
When I kneel in prayer, and with Thee, my God,
I commune as friend with friend.

There are depths of love that I cannot know
Till I cross the narrow sea;
There are heights ofjoy that I may not reach
Till I rest in peace with Thee.


608
Take time to be holy, speak oft with thy Lord;

Take time to be holy, speak oft with thy Lord;
Abide in Him always, and feed on His Word.
Make friends of God's children; help
those who are weak;
Forgetting in nothing His blessing to seek.

Take time to be holy, the world rushes on;
Spend much time in secret with Jesus alone—
By looking to Jesus, like Him thou shalt be;
Thy friends in thy conduct His likeness shall see.

Take time to be holy, let Him be thy Guide;
And run not before Him, whatever betide;
In joy or in sorrow still follow thy Lord,
And, looking to Jesus, still trust in His Word.

Take time to be holy, be calm in thy soul;
Each thought and each temper beneath His control:
Thus led by His Spirit to fountains of love,
Thou soon shalt be fitted for service above.


609
My heart is resting, O my God,

My heart is resting, O my God,
I will give thanks and sing:
My heart is at the secret source
Of every precious thing.

Now the frail vessel Thou hast made,
No hand bu t Thine shall fill—
The waters of the earth have failed,
And I am thirsty still.

I thirst for springs of heavenly life,
And here all day they rise;
I seek the treasure of Thy love,
And close at hand it lies.

And a" new song" is in my mouth,
To long-loved music set—
Glory to Thee for all the grace
I have not tasted yet!

A prayer reposing on His truth,
Who hath made all things mine,
That draws my captive will to Him,
And makes it one with Thine.


610
Must Jesus bear the cross alone,

Must Jesus bear the cross alone,
And all the world go free?
No, there's a cross for every one,
And there's a cross for me.

The consecrated cross I'll bear,
Till death shall set me free:
And then go home my crown to wear,
For there's a crown for me.

Upon the crystal pavement, down
At Jesus' pierced feet,
With joy I'll cast my golden crown,
And His dear name repeat.

O precious cross! O glorious crown!
O resurrection day!
Ye angels, from the stars come down,
And bear my soul away.

When the heart, made pure, is the temple

When the heart, made pure, is the
temple of the Lord,
And we feel His presence there,
Oh, the joy that comes when we
gather in His name,
At the hallowed hour of prayer.

c
He a precious unto all that believe Him,
He is precious unto all that receive Him,
Oh, the blessings we may claim,
when we gather in His name!
For the Lord will answer prayer.

There are floods of light from
His glory that descend,
When we think our prospect dim,
There are heights of love that His
children may attain,
By a closer walk with Him.

He will cheer us on when we follow where He leads,
And our hearts with gladness fill;
For we know by faith that His everlasting arms
Are beneath and round us still.

Let us grow in grace and a knowledge of the truth,
Let us dwell in perfect peace;
Till we all clasp hands in the palace of the King,
Where our joy shall never cease.


612
Thrice-Blessed Spirit! Giver of salvation,

Thrice-Blessed Spirit! Giver of salvation,
Purchased by Jesus on the cross of shame;
Dwell in our hearts; transform them
with Thy beauty—
Fairest adorning of our Saviour's name.

Thy sevenfold grace bestow upon us freely:—
Love, deep and full, to God and all mankind;
Joy in the Lord, 'mid every earthly sorrow;
Peace, calm and sweet, that guardeth heart and mind.

Make us long-suffering 'mid earth's provocations;
Gentleness give us, when enduring wrong;
Goodness impart, that we e'en foes may succour,
Faithfulness grant, to change our toil to song.

Meekness bestow, with humble self- abasement,
And Self-control, through Thy controlling might:
And as we list to every call of duty,
May we do all as in Thy searching sight.

Then with the gift of holiness within us;
We not less human, but made more divine;
Our lives replete with heaven's supernal beauty,
Ever declare— That beauty, Lord, is Thine.


613
My Saviour, oh, what glories shine

My Saviour, oh, what glories shine
Through all Thy life of love divine!
What wondrous grace and sympathy—
All this for me! all this for me!

c
O blessed Sa - viour, may I be ...
A living sac - - rirlce to Thee;
Both now and in eternity,
Yes, all for Thee! yes, all for Thee!

Thy vigils 'neath the lowly shade,
Despised, rejected, scorned, betrayed;
Thy sorrow in Gethsemane—
All this for me! all this for me!

The thorns that pierced Thy sacred brow,
The blood that saves so fully now;
Oh, wondrous cross of Calvary!—
All this for me! all this for me!

The riches of Thy peace and love,
The treasures of Thy home above,
Grace everlasting, full and free—
All this for me! all this for me!


614
When I came to Jesus, then my heart was sad;

When I came to Jesus, then my heart was sad;
But when He received me, then He made me glad.
Freely He forgave me, met my spirit's need;
Then He bade me follow whither He would lead.

c
I will follow Jesus, follow all the day!
Walking in His footsteps closely all the way.

Oft in hours of trial I have gone astray,
Into worldly bypaths from the narrow way;
But my Saviour sought me, brought me to His side;
Then again I followed Christ, the Crucified.

But I would not wander, gracious Lord, from Thee;
I would follow wholly, with true loyalty:
Every sin forsaking from my inmost soul;
Every thought surrendered to Thy grand control.

Teach me by Thy Spirit, and Thy Holy Word,
How I best may suffer, and obey Thee, Lord;
And however painful to obey may be,
Love can make it gladsome, aye to follow Thee.


615
Dying with Jesus, by death reckoned mine;

Dying with Jesus, by death reckoned mine;
Living with Jesus a new life divine;
Looking to Jesus till glory doth shine—
Moment by moment, O Lord, I am Thine.

c
Moment by moment I'm kept in His love,
Moment by moment I've life from above;
Looking to Jesus till glory doth shine;
Moment by moment, O Lord, I am Thine.

Never a battle with wrong for the right,
Never a contest that He doth not fight;
Lifting above us His banner so white—
Moment by moment I'm kept in His sight.

Never a trial that He is not there,
Never a burden that He doth not bear,
Never a sorrow that He doth not share—
Moment by moment I'm under His care.

Never a heartache, and never a groan,
Never a teardrop, and never a moan,
Never a danger—but there on the throne
Moment by moment He thinks of His own.

Never a weakness that He doth not feel,
Never a sickness that He cannot heal;
Moment by moment, in woe or in weal,
Jesus, my Saviour, abides with me still.


616
Take my life, and let it be Consecrated,

Take my life, and let it be
Consecrated, Lord, to Thee;
Take my moments and my days,
Let them flow in ceaseless praise.

Take my hands, and let them move
At the impulse of Thy love;
Take my feet, and let them be
Swift and beautiful for Thee.

Take my voice, and let me sing
Always, only, for my King;
Take my lips, and let them be
Filled with messages from Thee.

Take my silver and my gold;
Not a mite would I withhold:
Take my intellect, and use
Every power as Thou shalt choose.

Take my will, and make it Thine;
It shall be no longer mine:
Take my heart—it is Thine own,
It shall be Thy royal throne.

Take my love: my Lord, I pour
At Thy feet its treasure store:
Take myself; and I will be
Ever, only, all for Thee.


617
Christian, walk carefully: danger is near!

Christian, walk carefully: danger is near!
On in thy journey with trembling and fear;
Snares from without, and temptations within,
Seek to entice thee once more into sin.

c
Christian, walk carefully: danger is near!

Christian, walk cheerfully through the fierce storm,
Dark though the sky with its threats of alarm;
Soon will the clouds and the tempest be o'er,
Then with thy Saviour thou'lt rest evermore.

c
Christian, walk cheerfully: through the fierce storm.

Christian, walk prayerfully: oft wilt thou fall,
If thou forget on thy Saviour to call:
Safe thou shalt walk through each trial and care,
If thou art clad in the armour of prayer.

c
Christian, walk prayerfully: fear lest thou fall.

Christian, walk hopefully: sorrow and pain
Cease when the haven of rest thou shalt gain:
Then from the lips of the Judge, thy reward—
"Enter thou into the joy of thy Lord."

c
Christian, walk hopefully: rest thou shalt gain.


618
Yielded to God, my body, soul, and spirit,

Yielded to God, my body, soul, and spirit,
Oh, what rejoicing fills my peaceful breast!
All, all is well: no doubt nor fear disturbs me,
While on His promise now alone I rest.

Yielded to God, reposing 'neath His shadow,
Sunshine and gladness round my pathway fall;
Yielded to God, whose love dispels all sorrow,
He is my Refuge, and my All in All.

Yielded to God, my life and its devotion,
Yielded the service of each day and year;
Oh, what a peace pervades my every feeling!
Oh, what sweet visions on my sight appear!

Yielded to God, and in His holy keeping
My heart His temple evermore shall be;
Yielded to God, in willing consecration,
Blessed Redemeer, I am lost in Thee.


619
On Thee my heart is resting!

On Thee my heart is resting!
Ah, this is rest indeed!
What else, Almighty Saviour,
Can a poor sinner need?
Thy light is all my wisdom,
Thy love is all my stay;
Our Father's home in glory
Draws nearer every day.

My guilt is great, but greater
The mercy Thou dost give;
Thyself, a spotless Offering,
Hast died that I should live.
With Thee, my soul unfettered
Has risen from the dust;
Thy blood is all my treasure,
Thy Word is all my trust.

Through me, Thou gentle Master,
Thy purposes fulfil!
I yield myself for ever
To Thy most holy will.
What though I be but weakness,
My strength is not in me;
The poorest of Thy people
Has all things, having Thee.

When clouds are darkest round me,
Thou, Lord, art then most near,
My drooping faith to quicken,
My weary soul to cheer.
Safe nestling in Thy bosom,
I gaze upon Thy face;
In vain my foes would drive me
From Thee, my hiding-place.

'Tis Thou hast made me happy,
Tis Thou hast set me free;
To whom shall I give glory
For ever, but to Thee?
Of earthly love and blessing
Should every stream run dry,
Thy grace shall still be with me,
Thy grace, to live and die!


620
It passeth knowledge, that dear love of Thine,

It passeth knowledge, that dear love of Thine,
My Jesus, Saviour; yet this soul of mine
Would of Thy love, in all its breadth and length,
Its height and depth, its everlasting strength,
Know more and more.

It passeth telling, that dear love of Thine,
My Jesus, Saviour; yet these lips of mine
Would fain proclaim to sinners far and near
A love which can remove all guilty fear,
And love beget.

It passeth praises, that dear love of Thine,
My Jesus, Saviour; yet this heart of mine
Would sing that love, so full, so rich, so free,
Which brings a rebel sinner, such as me,
Nigh unto God.

But though I cannot sing, or tell, or know
The fulness of Thy love, while here below,
My empty vessel I may freely bring:
O Thou, who art of love the living spring,
My vessel fill.

I am an empty vessel—not one thought,
Or look of love, I ever to Thee brought;
Yet I may come, and come again to Thee,
With this, the empty sinner's only plea—
Thou lovest me.

Oh, fill me, Jesus, Saviour, with Thy love!
Lead, lead me to the living fount above;
Thither may I, in simple faith, draw nigh,
And never to another fountain fly,
But unto Thee.

And when my Jesus face to face I see,
When at His lofty throne I bow the knee,
Then of His love, in all its breadth and length,
Its height and depth, its everlasting strength,
My soul shall sing.


621
I GAVE My life for thee;

"I GAVE My life for thee;
My precious blood I shed,
That thou might'st ransomed be,
And quickened from the dead.
I gave My life for thee:
What hast thou given for Me?

"I spent long years for thee
In weariness and woe,
That an eternity
Of joy thou mightest know.
I spent long years for thee:
Hast thou spent one for Me?

"My Father's home of light,
My rainbow-circled throne,
I left for earthly night,
For wanderings sad and lone.
I left it all for thee:
Hast thou left aught for Me?

"I suffered much for thee—
More than thy tongue can tell,
Of bitterest agony—
To rescue thee from hell.
I suffered much for thee:
What canst thou bear for Me?

"And I have brought to thee,
Down from My home above.
Salvation full and free,
My pardon and My love.
Great gifts I brought to thee:
What hast thou brought to Me?

Oh, let thy life be given,
Thy years for Him be spent;
World-fetters all be riven,
And joy with suffering blent.
Bring thou thy worthless all:
Follow thy Saviour's call.


622
Try life was given for me! Thy blood,

Try life was given for me!
Thy blood, O Lord, was shed
That I might ransomed be,
And quickened from the dead.
Thy life was given for me:
What have I given for Thee?

Long years were spent for me
In weariness and woe,
That through eternity
Thy glory I might know.
Long years were spent for me:
Have I spent one for Thee?

Thy Father's home of light,
Thy rainbow-circled throne,
Were left for earthly night,
For wanderings sad and lone.
Yea, all was left for me:
Have I left aught for Thee?

Thou, Lord, hast borne for me
More than my tongue can tell
Of bitterest agony,
To rescue me from hell.
thou sufferedst all for me:
What have I borne for Thee?

And Thou hast brought to me,
Down from Thy home above,
Salvation full and free,
Thy pardon and Thy love.
Great gifts Thou broughtest me:
What have I brought to Thee?

Oh, let my life be given,
My years for Thee be spent;
World-fetters all be riven,
And joy with suffering blent:
To Thee my all I bring,
My Saviour and my King!


623
"Not I, but Christ, "be honoured,

"Not I, but Christ, "be honoured,loved, exalted;
"Not I, but Christ, "be seen, be known, be heard;
"Not I, but Christ, "in every look and action;
"Not I, but Christ, "in every thought and word.

"Not I, but Christ, "to gently soothe in sorrow;
"Not I, but Christ, "to wipe the falling tear;
"Not I, but Christ, "to lift the weary burden;
"Not I, but Christ, "to hush away all fear.

"Not I, but Christ, "in lowly, silent labour;
"Not I, but Christ, "in humble,earnest toil;
Christ, only Christ! no show, no ostentation;
Christ, none but Christ, the gatherer of the spoil.

Christ, only Christ, ere long will fill my vision;
Glory excelling, soon, full soon, I'll see—
Christ, only Christ, my every wish fulfilling—
Christ, only Christ, my All in All to be.


624
Oh, the bitter shame and sorrow,

Oh, the bitter shame and sorrow,
That a time could ever be,
When I let the Saviour's pity
Plead in vain; and proudly answered,
"All of self, and none of Thee!"

Yet He found me; I beheld Him
Bleeding on the accursdd tree:
Heard Him pray:" Forgive them, Father!
"And my wistful heart said faintly,
"Some of self, and some of Thee!"

Day by day His tender mercy,
Healing, helping, full and free;
Sweet and strong, and ah! so patient,
Brought me lower, while I whispered,
"Less of self, and more of Thee!"

Higher than the highest heavens,
Deeper than the deepest sea,
Lord, Thy love at last hath conquered;
Grant me now my supplication—
"None of self, and all of Thee!"


625
Thou sweet beloved will of God,

Thou sweet beloved will of God,
My anchor ground, my fortress hill,
My spirit's silent fair abode,
In Thee I hide me, and am still.

O will, that wiliest good alone,
Lead thou the way, thou guidest
A little child, I follow on, [best:
And trusting, lean upon thy breast.

Thy beautiful sweet will, my God,
Holds fast in its sublime embrace
My captive will, a gladsome bird,
Prisoned in such a realm of grace.

Within this place of certain good
Love evermore expands her wings,
Or nestling in Thy perfect choice.
Abides content with what it brings.

Oh, lightest burden, sweetest yoke!
It lifts, it bears my happy soul,
It giveth wings to this poor heart;
My freedom is Thy grand control.

Upon God's will I lay me down,
As child upon its mother's breast;
No silken couch, nor softest bed,
Could ever give me such deep rest.

Thy wonderful grand will, my God,
With triumph now I make it mine;
And faith shall cry a joyous, Yes!
To every dear command of Thine.


626
Something every heart is loving;

Something every heart is loving;
If not Jesus, none can rest:
Lord, my heart to Thee is given—
Take it, for it loves Thee best.

Thus I cast the world behind me,
Jesus most beloved shall be;
Beauteous more than all things beauteous,
He alone is joy to me.

Bright with all eternal radiance
Is the glory of Thy face;
Thou art loving, sweet, and tender,
Full of pity, full of grace.

When I hated, Thou didst love me,
Shedd'st for me Thy precious blood;
Still Thou lovest, lovest ever:
Shall I not love Thee, my God?

Keep my heart still faithful to Thee,
That my earthly life may be
But a shadow to that glory
Of my hidden life in Thee!


627
Anywhere with Jesus I can safely go!

Anywhere with Jesus I can safely go!
Anywhere He leads me in this world below!
Anywhere without Him dearest joys would fade—
Anywhere with Jesus, I am not afraid!

c
Anywhere! anywhere I Fear I cannot know!
Anywhere with Jesus I can safely go!

Anywhere with Jesus I am not alone!
Other friends may fail me, He is still my own!
Though His hand may lead me over dreariest ways,
Anywhere with Jesus is a house of praise!

Anywhere with Jesus I can go to sleep,
When the darkling shadows round about me creep!
Knowing I shall waken, never more to roam:
Anywhere with Jesus will be home,sweet home!


628
ABIDING, oh, so wondrous sweet!

ABIDING, oh, so wondrous sweet!
I'm resting at the Saviour's feet;
I trust in Him; I'm satisfied,
I'm resting in the Crucified!

c
Abi - - ding, abi - - ding,
Oh, how wondrous sweet!
I'm rest - - ing, rest - - ing
At the Saviour's feet. ...

He speaks, and by His word is given
His peace, a rich foretaste of heaven;
Not as the world, He peace doth give:
'Tis through this hope my soul shall live.

I live, but through His grace alone;
By whom the mighty work is done;
Dead to myself, alive to Him,
I count all loss His rest to win.

Now rest, my heart, the work is done,
I'm saved by faith through Christ the
Son! Let every power my soul employ?
To tell the world my peace and joy.


629
Precious Saviour, I will praise Thee,

Precious Saviour, I will praise Thee,
Thine, and only Thine, I am;
For the cleansing blood has reached me;
Glory, glory to the Lamb!

c
Glory, glory, Jesus saves me!
Blessed be His holy name;
For the cleansing blood has reached me,
Hallelujah to the Lamb!

Long my yearning heart was trying
To enjoy this perfect rest;
But when I gave over" trying,"—
Simply trusting, I was blest.

I am trusting every moment
In the precious blood applied;
Calmly resting at the fountain,
Dwelling at my Saviours side

Consecrated to Thy service,
I would live and die for Thee,
Gladly tell the wondrous story
Of salvation full and free.


630
Alas! and did my Saviour bleed?

Alas! and did my Saviour bleed?
And did my Sovereign die?
Would He devote that sacred head
For such a worm as I?

c
Help me, dear Saviour, Thee to own,
And ever faithful be;
And when Thou sittest on Thy throne,
O Lord, remember me.

Was it for crimes that I had done
He groaned upon the tree?
Amazing pity! grace unknown!
And love beyond degree!

Well might the sun in darkness hide,
And shut his glories in,
When Christ, the mighty Maker, died
For man, the creature's sin.

Thus might I hide my blushing face
Whilst His dear cross appears,
Dissolve my heart in thankfulness,
And melt mine eyes to tears.

But drops of grief can ne'er repay
The debt of love I owe:
Here, Lord, I give myself away;
'Tis all that I can do.


631
There is a Light, a blessed Light,

There is a Light, a blessed Light,
That comes from God above;
And in the face of Christ the Lord
Reflects the Father's love.

c
Let us walk ... in the Light! ...
Ever walk in the Light of God;
Let us walk ... in the Light! ...
Ever walk in the Light of God.

There is a Light, a glorious Light,
That falls upon our way;
And brighter shineth as we go,
Till lost in perfect day.

There is a Light, a holy Light,
By which we now behold
The jasper walls, the pearly gates,
And streets of shining gold.

O blessed, blessed holy Light,
To all so freely given;
Shine forth, shine forth, O Light of Life,
And guide us safe to heaven.


632
More love to Thee, O Christ,

More love to Thee, O Christ,
More love to Thee;
Hear Thou the prayer I make
On bended knee;
This is my earnest plea—
More love, O Christ, to Thee,
More love to Thee!
More love to Thee!

Once earthly joy I craved,
Sought peace and rest;
Now Thee alone I seek,
Give what is best:
This all my prayer shall be—
More love, O Christ, to Thee,
More love to Thee!

Let sorrow do its work,
Send grief and pain;
Sweet are Thy messengers,
Sweet their refrain,
When they can sing with me—
More love, O Christ, to Thee,
More love to Thee!

Then shall my latest breath
Whisper Thy praise;
This be the parting cry
My heart shall raise—
This still its prayer shall be—
More love, O Christ, to Thee,
More love to Thee!


633
Love, that wilt not let me go,

Love, that wilt not let me go,
I rest my weary soul in Thee;
I give Thee back the life I owe,
That in Thine ocean depths its flow
May richer, fuller be.

O Light, that followest all my way,
I yield my flickering torch to Thee;
My heart restores its borrowed ray,
That in Thy sunshine's blaze its day
May brighter, fairer be.

O Joy, that seekest me through pain,
I cannot close my heart to Thee;
I trace the rainbow through the rain,
And feel the promise is not vain
That morn shall tearless be.

O cross, that liftest up my head,
I dare not ask to fly from thee;
I lay in dust life's glory dead,
And from the ground there blossoms red
Life that shall endless be.


634
Saviour! Thy dying love Thou gavest me,

Saviour! Thy dying love
Thou gavest me,
Nor should I aught withhold,
My Lord, from Thee;
In love my soul would bow,
My heart fulfil its vow,
Some offering bring Thee now,
Something for Thee.

At the blest mercy-seat,
Pleading for me,
My feeb'e faith looks up,
Jesus, to Thee:
Help me the cross to bear,
Thy wondrous lcve declare,
Some song to raise, or prayer,
Something for Thee.

Give me a faithful heart—
Likeness to Thee,—
That each departing day
Henceforth may see
Some work of love begun,
Some deed of kindness done,
Some wanderer sought and won,
Something for Thee.

All that I am and have—
Thy gifts so free—
In joy, in grief, through life,
O Lord, for Thee!
And when Thy face I see,
My ransomed soul shall be,
Through all eternity,
Something for Thee.


635
Jesus! I am resting, resting

Jesus! I am resting, resting
In the joy of what Thou art;
I am finding out the greatness
Of Thy loving heart.
Thou hast bid me gaze upon Thee,
And Thy beauty fills my soul;
For, by Thy transforming power
Thou hast made me whole.

c
Jesus! I am resting, resting in the joy of what Thou art;
I am finding out the greatness of Thy loving heart.

Oh, how great Thy loving-kindness,
Vaster, broader than the sea!
Oh, how marvellous Thy goodness,
Lavished all on me!
Yes, I rest in Thee, Beloved,
Know what wealth of grace is Thine
Know Thy certainty of promise,
And have made it mine.

Simply trusting Thee, Lord Jesus,
I behold Thee as Thou art,
And Thy love so pure, so changeless,
Satisfies my heart—
Satisfies its deepest longings,
Meets, supplies its every need,
Compasseth me round with blessings:
Thine is love indeed!

Ever lift Thy face upon me,
As I work and wait for Thee;
Resting 'neath Thy smile, Lord Jesus,
Earth's dark shadows flee.
Brightness of my Father's glory,
Sunshine of my Father's face,
Keep me ever trusting, resting;
Fill me with Thy grace!


636
Help me, O Lord, the God of my salvation!

Help me, O Lord, the God of my salvation!
I have no hope, no refuge but in Thee;
Help me to make this perfect consecration,
In life or death Thine evermore to be.

Help me, O Lord, to keep my pledge unbroken!
Guard Thou my ways, my thoughts,
my tongue, my heart;
Help me to trust the word which Thou hast spoken,
That from Thy paths my feet may ne'er depart.

Help me, O Lord, when sore temptations press me!
Oh, lift the clouds that hide Thee from my sight!
Help me, O Lord, when anxious cares distress me,
To look beyond, where all is calm and bright.

Help me, O Lord! My strength is only weakness;
Thine, Thine the power by which alone I live;
Help me each day to bear the cross with meekness,
Till Thou at last the promised crown shalt give.


637
My spirit, soul, and body, Jesus, I give to Thee,

My spirit, soul, and body,
Jesus, I give to Thee,
A consecrated offering,
Thine evermore to be.
My all is on the altar;
Lord, I am all Thine own;
Oh, may my faith ne'er falter!
Lord, keep me Thine alone.

O Jesus, mighty Saviour!
I trust in Thy great name,
I look for Thy salvation,
Thy promise now I claim.
Now, Lord, I yield my members,
From sin's dominion free,
For warfare and for triumph,
As weapons unto Thee.

Oh, blissful self-surrender,
To live, my Lord, by Thee!
Now, Son of God, my Saviour,
Live out Thy life in me.
I'm Thine, O blessed Jesus,
Washed in Thy precious blood,
Sealed by Thy Holy Spirit,
A sacrifice to God.


638
Lord, for to-morrow and its needs

Lord, for to-morrow and its needs
I do not pray;
Keep me, my God, from stain of sin
Just for to-day.

Let me do faithfully Thy work,
And duly pray;
Let me be kind in word and deed,
Just for to-day.

Let me no wrong or idle word,
Unthinking, say:
Set Thou a seal upon my lips—
Just for to-day.

So for to-morrow and its needs
I do not pray;
But keep me, guide me, hold me,Lord—
Just for to-day.


639
Closer, Lord, to Thee I cling,

Closer, Lord, to Thee I cling,
Closer still to Thee;
Safe beneath Thy sheltering wing
I would ever be;
Rude the blast of doubt and sin,
Fierce assaults without, within:
Help me, Lord, the battle win—
Closer, Lord, to Thee!

Closer yet, O Lord, my Rock,
Refuge of my soul;
Dread I not the tempest shock,
Though the billows roll:
Wildest storm cannot alarm,
For to me can come no harm,
Leaning on Thy loving arm—
Closer, Lord, to Thee!

Closer still, my Help, my Stay,
Closer, closer still;
Meekly there I learn to say,
"Father, not my will!"
Learn that in affliction's hour,
When the clouds of sorrow lour,
Love directs Thy hand of power-
Closer, Lord to Thee!

Closer, Lord, to Thee I come,
Light of life divine;
Through the ever blessed Son,
Joy and peace are mine;
Let me in Thy love abide,
Keep me ever near Thy side,
In the" Rock of Ages" hide-
Closer, Lord, to Thee!


640
I would not ask for earthly store—

I would not ask for earthly store—
Thou wilt my need supply;
But I would covet, more and more,
The clear and single eye,
To see my duty face to face,
And trust Thee, Lord, for daily grace.

c
Then shall my heart keep sing . . . ing,
While to the cross I cling; . .
For rest is sweet at Jesus' feet,
While homeward faith keeps winging,
While homeward faith keeps winging.

I care not for the empty show
That thoughtless worldlings see;
But gladly do the best I know,
And leave the rest with Thee;—
Well satisfied that sweet reward
Is sure to those who trust the Lord,

Whate'er the crosses mine shall be,
I would not dare to shun;
But only ask to live for Thee,
And that Thy will be done;
Thy will, O Lord, be mine each day,
While pressing on my homeward way.

And when at last, my labour o'er,
I cross the narrow sea,
Grant, Lord, that on the other shore
My soul may dwell with Thee;
And learn what here I cannot know,
Why Thou hast ever loved me so.


641
I am trusting Thee, Lord Jesus,

I am trusting Thee, Lord Jesus,
Trusting only Thee!
Trusting Thee for full salvation,
Great and free.

c
I . am . trust - ing, .
Trusting only Thee!
I am trust - ing, . trust - ing,.
Trusting only Thee!

I am trusting Thee for pardon,
At Thy feet I bow;
For Thy grace and tender mercy,
Trusting now.

I am trusting Thee for cleansing
In the crimson flood;
Trusting Thee to make me holy
By Thy blood.

I am trusting Thee for power,
Thine can never fail;
Words which Thou Thyself shalt give me,
Must prevail.

I am trusting Thee, Lord Jesus;
Never let me fall;
I am trusting Thee for ever
And for all!

When we walk with the Lord In the light

When we walk with the Lord
In the light of His Word,
What a glory He sheds on our way!
While we do His good will.
He abides with us still,
And with all who will trust and obey.

c
Trust and obey, for there's no other way
To be happy in Jesus but to trust and obey.

Not a shadow can rise
Not a cloud in the skies,
But His smile quickly drives it away;
Not a doubt nor a fear,
Not a sigh nor a tear,
Can abide while we trust and obey.

Not a burden we bear,
Not a sorrow we share,
But our toil He doth richly repay;
Not a grief nor a loss,
Not a frown nor a cross,
But is blest if we trust and obey.

But we never can prove
The delights of His love,
Until all on the altar we lay;
For the favour He shows,
And the joy He bestows,
Are for them who will trust and obey.

Then in fellowship sweet
We will sit at His feet,
Or we'll walk by His side in the way;
What He says we will do,
Where He sends we will go,
Never fear, only trust and obey.


643
Jesus redeemed and made me whole,

Jesus redeemed and made me whole,
I can forget Him never;
Out of the depths He brought my soul;
Now I am His for ever.

c
I'm holding on, I'm holding on,
Daily in grace I'm growing;
Fast to the Rock I'm holding on,
Peace to my heart is Sowing.

Great is the love of Christ my King,
Love that no power can sever;
Joyful and glad my tongue shall sing
Praise to His name for ever.

If on the Lord my care I cast,
He will forsake me never;
Firm on the Rock of Ages fast
I shall abide for ever.

He has prepared a home for me
Over the silent river;
There with the blest I soon shall be,
There I shall dwell for ever.


644
In the shadow of His wings

In the shadow of His wings
There is rest, sweet rest;
There is rest from care and labour,
There is rest for friend and neighbour:
In the shadow of His wings
There is rest, sweet rest;
In the shadow of His wings
There is rest. ...

c
There is rest! . . there is peace! . .
There is joy! . . in the shadow of His wings.
There is rest! . . there is peace! . .
There is joy! . . in the shadow of His wings.

In the shadow of His wings
There is peace, sweet peace;
Peace that passeth understanding,
Peace, sweet peace, that knows no ending;
In the shadow of His wings
There is peace, sweet peace;
In the shadow of His wings
There is peace. . .

In the shadow of His wings
There is joy, glad joy;
There is joy to tell the story,
Joy exceeding, full of glory:
In the shadow of His wings
There is joy, glad joy.
In the shadow of His wings
There is joy. . .


645
I have learnt a heavenly secret,

I have learnt a heavenly secret,
Yet I know not how or where;
But I know 'tis sweet and precious,
Ever true, and glad, and fair;
And that God in heaven reveals it
To all whose ears can hear.

And I know that ere I learnt it
Oft my way was lone and hard;
And anon in life's glad music
There was always that which jarred.
And a hidden, dreary discord
That all its sweetness marred.

But my harp of life was lifted
By the Lord, who knew the range
Of its many strings who made it,
And He struck a keynote strange:
At the touch of Christ my Master
I heard the music change.

Then no more it failed and faltered.
And no longer sobbed and strove;
But it seemed to soar and mingle
With the song of heaven above;
For the pierced hand of Jesus
Had struck the keynote—LOVE.

All thy heart's long-prisoned music
Let the Master's hand set free—
Let Him whisper now His secret,
As He whispered once to me:
"Child, My love's the golden keynote
Of all My will for thee!"


646
Jesus, Beloved of my heart,

Jesus, Beloved of my heart,
Thy grace I earnestly implore;
Oh, if Thou wilt the gift impart,
I'll use it but to love Thee more.

c
Let others dream ... of jewelled walls, ...
Of golden cities fair to see; ...
No glorious scene ... my soul enthralls, ...
Where'er Thou art is heaven for me. ...

The brightest forms of earthly love
Are dull beside Thine own to me;
With wistful eyes I look above,
And wonder when Thy face I'll see.

Though Paradise has many joys,
And flowers of beauty fair to see,
Not gates of pearl nor angel's voice
Shall thrill my soul like love of Thee.

Without Thee no celestial light
Shall shine to make my soul content;
But with Thee this sad earth is bright,
And glows with joy from heaven lent.


647
Oh, what fellowship; oh, what joy is mine,

Oh, what fellowship; oh, what joy is mine,
Resting in the everlasting arms!
Oh, what blessedness; oh, what peace divine.
Resting in the everlasting arms!

c
Rest - - ing, rest - - ing,
Safe and secure from all alarms;
Rest - - ing, rest - - ing,
Resting in the everlasting arms!

Oh, how safe am I in this pilgrim way,
Resting in the everlasting arms!
Oh, how bright the path grows from day to day,
Resting in the everlasting arms!

What have I to dread, what have I to fear,
Resting in the everlasting arms?
I have perfect peace with my Saviour
near, Resting in the everlasting arms!


648
The love that Jesus had for me,

The love that Jesus had for me,
To suffer on the cruel tree.
That I a ransomed soul might be,
Is more than tongue can tell!

c
His love is more than tongue can tell! . . .
His love is more than tongue can tell! . . .
The love that Jesus had for me
Is more than tongue can tell!

The bitter sorrow that He bore,
And oh, that crown of thorns He wore,
That I might live for evermore,
Is more than tongue can tell!

The peace I have in Him, my Lord,
Who pleads before the throne of God,
The merit of His precious blood,
Is more than tongue can tell!

The joy that comes when He is near,
The rest He gives, so free from fear,
The hope in Him, so bright and clear,
Is more than tongue can tell!


649
I know I love Thee better, Lord,

I know I love Thee better, Lord,
Than any earthly joy;
For Thou hast given me the peace
Which nothing can destroy.

c
The half has never yet been told, ...
Of love so full and free!
The half has never yet been told, ...
The blood—it cleanseth me! ...

I know that Thou art nearer still
Than any earthly throng;
And sweeter is the thought of Thee
Than any lovely song.

Thou hast put gladness in my heart;
Then may I well be glad!
Without the secret of Thy love,
I could not but be sad.

O Saviour, precious Saviour, mine!
What will Thy presence be,
If such a life of joy can crown
Our walk on earth with Thee!


650
Ring the bells of heaven! there is joy to-day,

Ring the bells of heaven! there is joy to-day,
For a soul returning from the wild!
See! the Father meets him out upon the way,
Welcoming His weary, wandering child.

c
Glory I glory! how the angels sing;
Glory! glory! how the loud harps ring!
'Tis the ransomed army, like a mighty sea,
Pealing forth the anthem of the free.

Ring the bells of heaven! there is joy to-day,
For the wanderer now is reconciled;
Yes, a soul is rescued from his sinful way,
And is bora anew a ransomed child.

Ring the bells of heaven! spread the feast to-day!
Angels, swell the glad, triumphant strain!
Tell the joyful tidings, bear it far away!
For a precious soul is bora again.


651
To the Cross of Christ I cling;

To the Cross of Christ I cling;
Though but faint my faith may be,
Yet this thought doth comfort bring:
Jesus holdeth me.

c
Holdeth me, He holdeth me;
Though but faint my hold may be,
Yet this thought doth comfort bring:
Jesus holdeth me.

Low at Jesus' feet I plead;
Broken though my prayer may be,
Precious is the thought indeed!
Jesus pleads for me.

Can I say I love the Lord?
Cold at times my love may be,
Yet how precious is the word:
Jesus loveth me.


652
Like a river glorious is God's perfect peace,

Like a river glorious is God's perfect peace,
Over all victorious in its bright increase;
Perfect, yet it floweth fuller every day,—
Perfect, yet it groweth deeper all the way.

c
Stayed upon Jehovah hearts are fully blest;
Finding, as He promised, perfect peace and rest.

Hidden in the hollow of His blessed hand,
Never foe can follow, never traitor stand;
Not a surge of worry, not a shade of care,
Not a blast of hurry moves the spirit there.

Every joy or trial falleth from above,
Traced upon our dial by the Sun of Love.
We may trust Him fully all for us to do:
They who trust Him wholly find Him wholly true.


653
For Thy goodness, O my Saviour,

For Thy goodness, O my Saviour,
I would praise Thee o'er and o'er;
May the Holy Spirit teach me
How to love Thee more and more.

c
More and more, . . more and more! ...
Oh to love Thee, Saviour, more and more!
More and more, . . more and more! ...
Oh to love Thee, Saviour, more and more!

For the blessings that surround me,
Lord, Thy mercy I adore;
For Thy care so deep and tender,
I would love Thee more and more.

Raging tempest, rolling billow,
Thou hast brought me safely o'er;
Thou hast led me, safely led me,
And I long to love Thee more!

Till my journey here is ended,
Till I reach the heavenly shore,
This my earnest supplication—
That my soul may love Thee more.


654
Rejoice! rejoice! ye saints, rejoice!

Rejoice! rejoice! ye saints, rejoice!
Rejoice with one accord;
Rejoice with all your heart and voice,
In Christ the exalted Lord.

c
"Rejoice! . . . Rejoice in the Lord!
Rejoice in the Lord alway;
Rejoice! . . . Rejoice in the Lord!
And again I say, Rejoice!"

Rejoice! rejoice! lift up your head,
And praise the living God,
That for your souls the Saviour shed
His own most precious blood.

Rejoice! rejoice! let praise abound
Before Jehovah's throne,
For dead ones raised, and lost ones found,
And prodigals brought home.

Rejoice! rejoice! the Lord will come,
According to His word,
And gather all His ransomed home,
"For ever with the Lord."


655
God's almighty arms are round me:

God's almighty arms are round me:
Peace, peace is mine!
Judgment scenes need not confound me:
Peace, peace is mine!
Jesus came Himself and sought me;
Sold to Death, He found and bought me;
Then my blessed freedom taught me—
Peace, peace is mine!

While I hear life's rugged billows,
Peace, peace is mine!
Why suspend my harp on willows?
Peace, peace is mine!
I may sing, with Christ beside me,
Though a thousand ills betide me;
Safely He hath sworn to guide me:
Peace, peace is mine!

Every trial draws Him nearer:
Peace, peace is mine!
All His strokes but make Him dearer;
Peace, peace is mine!
Bless I then the hand that smiteth
Gently, and to heal delighteth;
'Tis against my sins He fighteth;
Peace, peace is mine!

Welcome every rising sunlight,
Peace, peace is mine!
Nearer home each rolling midnight:
Peace, peace is mine!
Death and hell cannot appal me;
Safe in Christ whate'er befal me;
Calmly wait I till He call me:
Peace, peace is mine!


656
O GENTLE, sweet, and tender Love!

O GENTLE, sweet, and tender Love!
Greatest and best Thou art!
Thou comest on Thine angel-wing
Straight from our Father's heart.

c
Spirit of love, expand Thy wings,
Brood o'er my heart to-day;
Fill me with heavenly tenderness
As now to Thee I pray.

God sendeth Thee, His messenger,
From His bright home above;
And surely all that is of Thee
Are His, for" God is love!"

Faith leadeth us through earthly life
Down to the gates of death:
There stays; for where" they see His face"
They have no need of faith.

Hope cometh to the threshold fair,
But cannot pass it o'er;
For there our hopes are all fulfilled,
For ever, evermore.

But love goes through the pearly gates
Into the city blest,
And flies on pinions swift and sure,
Straight to our Father's breast.


657
There comes to my heart one sweet

There comes to my heart one sweet strain, ...
A glad and a joyous refrain, ...
I sing it again and again,
Sweet peace, the gift of God's love.

c
Peace, peace, sweet peace,
Wonderful gift from above; ...
Oh, wonderful, wonderful peace,
Sweet peace, the gift of God's love.

Through Christ on the cross peace was made, ...
My debt by His death was all paid, ...
No other foundation is laid
For peace, the gift of God's love.

When Jesus as Lord I had crown'd, ...
My heart with His peace did abound, ...
In Him a rich blessing I found,
Sweet peace, the gift of God's love.

In Jesus at peace I abide, . .
And while I keep close to His side, ...
There's nothing but peace can betide,
Sweet peace, the gift of God's love.


658
Far away in the depths of my spirit tonight

Far away in the depths of my spirit tonight
Rolls a melody sweeter than psalm;
In celestial-like strains it unceasingly falls
O'er my soul like an infinite calm.

c
Peace! peace! wonderful peace!
Coming down from the Father above,
Sweep over my spirit for ever, I pray,
In fathomless billows of love.

What a treasure I have in this wonderful peace
Which abides in the depths of my soul,
So secure that no power can e'er take it away
While the years of eternity roll.

I am resting to-night in this wonderful peace,
I have yielded to Jesus' control;
For I'm kept from all danger by night and by day,
And His glory is filling my soul.

And methinks when I rise to that city of peace,
Where its Author with joy I shall see,
That one of the songs which the ransomed will sing
In that heavenly kingdom shall be:


659
My Jesus, I love Thee, I know Thou art mine!

My Jesus, I love Thee, I know Thou art mine!
For Thee all the pleasures of sin I resign;
My gracious Redeemer, my Saviour art Thou!
If ever I loved Thee, my Jesus, 'tis now!

I love Thee, because Thou hast first loved me,
And purchased my pardon on Calvary's tree;
I love Thee for wearing the thorns on Thy brow;
If ever I loved Thee, my Jesus, 'tis now!

I will love Thee in life, I will love Thee in death,
And praise Thee as long as Thou lendest me breath;
And say when the death-dew lies cold on my brow,
"If ever I loved Thee, my Jesus, 'tis now!"

In mansions of glory and endless delight,
I'll ever adore Thee in heaven so bright;
I'll sing with the glittering crown on my brow,
"If ever I loved Thee, my Jesus, 'tis now!"


660
When this passing world is done,

When this passing world is done,
When has sunk yon radiant sun,
When the pearly gate I gain,
Never to go out again;
Then, Lord, shall I fully know—
Not till then—how much I owe.

When I stand before the throne,
Dressed in beauty not my own;
When I see Thee as Thou art,
Love Thee with unsinning heart:
Then, Lord, shall I fully know—
Not till then—how much I owe.

Chosen, not for good in me,
Wakened up from wrath to flee,
Hidden in the Saviour's side,
By the Spirit sanctified:
Teach me, Lord, on earth to show,
By my love, how much I owe.


661
"My times are in Thy hand:"

"My times are in Thy hand:"
My God, I wish them there;
My life, my friends, my soul—I leave
Entirely to Thy care.

"My times are in Thy hand,"
Whatever they may be;
Pleasing, or painful, dark or bright,
As best may seem to Thee.

"My times are in Thy hand;"
Why should I doubt or fear?
My Father's hand will never cause
His child a needless tear.

"My times are in Thy hand,"
Jesus, the crucified!
The hand my cruel sins had pierced,
Is now my guard and guide.


662
Gracious Spirit, Holy Ghost,

Gracious Spirit, Holy Ghost,
Taught by Thee, we covet most
Of Thy gifts at Pentecost,
Holy, heavenly love.

Love is kind, and suffers long;
Love is meek, and thinks no wrong;
Love, than death itself more strong;
Give us heavenly love.

Prophecy will fade away,
Melting in the light of day;
Love will ever with us stay:
Give us heavenly love.

Faith will vanish into sight;
Hope be emptied in delight;
Love in heaven will shine more bright;
Give us heavenly love.

Faith and hope and love we see
Joining hand in hand agree;
But the greatest of the three,
And the best, is love.

From the overshadowing
Of Thy gold and silver wing,
Shed on us, who to Thee sing,
Holy, heavenly love.


663
We bless Thee for Thy peace, O God,

We bless Thee for Thy peace, O God,
Deep as the unfathomed sea,
Which falls like sunshine on the road
Of those who trust in Thee.

We ask not, Father, for repose
Which comes from outward rest,
If we may have thro' all life's woes
Thy peace within our breast.

That peace which suffers and is strong,
Trusts where it cannot see,
Deems not the trial way too long,
But leaves the end with Thee.

That peace which flows serene and deep,
A river in the soul
Whose banks a living verdure keep—
God's sunshine o'er the whole.

O Father, give our hearts this peace,
Whate'er the outward be,
Till all life's discipline shall cease,
And we go home to Thee.


664
Yes, for me, for me He careth,

Yes, for me, for me He careth,
With a brother's tender care;
Yes, with me, with me He shareth
Every burden, every fear.

c
Thus I wait ... for His returning,
Singing all . . the way to heaven;
Such the joy - - ful song of morning,
Such the tran - - quil song of even.

Yes, for me He standeth pleading
At the mercy-seat above,
Ever for me interceding,
Constant in untiring love.

Yea, in me abroad He sheddeth
Joys unearthly, love, and light;
And to cover me He spreadeth
His paternal wing of might.

Yes, in me, in me He dwelleth;
I in Him, and He in me;
And my empty soul He filleth
Here and through eternity.


665
Repeat the story o'er and o'er,

Repeat the story o'er and o'er,
Of grace so full and free;
I love to hear it more and more,
Since grace has rescued me.

The half . . was never told, ...
The half . . was never told, . .
Of grace divine, so wonderful,
The half . . was never told. . .

Of peace I only knew the name;
Nor found my soul its rest,
Until the sweet-voiced angel came
To soothe my weary breast.

c
Of peace divine, so wonderful,
The half . . was never told. ...

My highest place is lying low
At my Redeemer's feet;
No real joy in life I know,
But in His service sweet.

c
Of joy divine, so wonderful,
The half . . was never told. ...

And oh, what rapture will it be
With all the host above,
To sing through all eternity
The wonders of His love!

c
Of love divine, so wonderful,
The half . . was never told. ...


666
peace divine and pure,In wildest storm secure,

peace divine and pure,
In wildest storm secure,
That feels the summer's glow
'Mid wintry ice and snow;
When may I rise to this dear prize,
And fill my breast with inward rest?

My life is tempest-tossed,
With wayward currents crossed,
Unhallowed cares deface
The soul's most holy place;
How may I bind these cares, and find
All passion spent in calm content?

And though through storm and stress
I sail the vasty seas
Of troubled thought—in vain
I toil the shore to gain:
For yet within I'd feel my sin,
And still afar would shine Thy star.

Lord, only from Thy face
Beams forth this mystic grace,
And only in Thy love,
Beneath, around, above,
May my weak soul grow great and whole,
And peace divine be fully mine.


667
Saviour, teach me, day by day,

Saviour, teach me, day by day,
Love's sweet lesson to obey;
Sweeter lesson cannot be,
Loving Him who first loved me.
Teach me, I am not my own,
I am Thine and Thine alone;
Thine to keep, to rule, to save,
From all sin that would enslave.

With a child's glad heart of love,
At Thy bidding may I move;
Prompt to serve and follow Thee,
Loving Him who first loved me.
Tho' Thy will should cross my own,
May it instantly be done;
Thus may I rejoice to show
That I feel the love I owe.

Thine, Lord, was a bitter cup,
Thou didst meekly drink it up;
Thou, the Father's only Son,
Ever saidst, Thy will be done.
Teach me thus Thy steps to trace,
Strong to follow in Thy grace;
Learning how to love from Thee,
Loving Him who so loved me.

Love in loving finds employ,
In obedience all her joy;
Ever new that joy will be,
Loving Him who first loved me.
Though a foolish child and weak,
More than this I need not seek;
Singing till Thy face I see,
Of His love who first loved me.


668
Resting on the faithfulness of Christ our Lord,

Resting on the faithfulness of Christ our Lord,
Resting on the fulness of His own sure word;
Resting on His wisdom, on His love and power,
Resting on His covenant from hour to hour.

Resting 'neath His guiding hand for untracked days,
Resting 'neath His shadow from the noontide rays;
Resting at the eventide, beneath His wing,
In the fair pavilion of our Saviour King.

Resting in the fortress while the foe is nigh,
Resting in the lifeboat while the waves roll high;
Resting in His chariot for the swift glad race,
Resting, always resting, in His boundless grace.

Resting in the pastures, and beneath the Rock,
Resting by the waters where He leads His flock;
Resting, while we listen at His glorious feet,
Resting in His arms of love—oh,rest complete!

Resting and believing, let us onward press,
Resting on Himself, "the Lord our Righteousness!"
Resting and rejoicing, let His saved ones sing—
"Glory, glory, glory be to Christ our King!"


669
Ho, my comrades! see the signal

Ho, my comrades! see the signal
Waving in the sky!
Reinforcements now appearing,
Victory is nigh!

c
"Hold the fort, for I am coming!"
Jesus signals still;
Wave the answer back to heaven,
"By Thy grace we will!"

See the mighty host advancing,
Satan leading on;
Mighty men around us falling,
Courage almost gone!

See the glorious banner waving!
Hear the trumpet blow!
In our leader's name we'll triumph
Over every foe!

Fierce and long the battle rages,
But our help is near;
Onward comes our great Commander,
Cheer, my comrades, cheer!


670
ONWARD, soldiers! onward to-day!

ONWARD, soldiers! onward to-day!
Christ our Leader calls us away;
Quickly hasten forth to the field;
March with sword and shield.

c
"Forward, forward!" thus saith the Lord,
Fear not, faint not, trust in His Word;
He will guard us, He will defend,
Till the strife shall end.

Onward, soldiers! make no delay;
Hear the orders, hear and obey;
On to victory, on let us go,
Braving every foe.

Onward, soldiers! on for the right,
Let our banners wave in the light;
Soon the victor's song we will sing,
"Praise to God our King."


671
AWAKE! for the trumpet is sounding!

AWAKE! for the trumpet is sounding!
Awake to its call, and obey!
The voice of our Leader cries, "Onward!
Oh, let us no longer delay!

c
"No truce while the foe is unconquered;
No laying the armour down!
No peace till the battle is ended,
And victory wins the crown!

Then gird on the sword of the Spirit,
With helmet, and breastplate, and shield;
And valiantly follow your Captain,
Determined you never will yield!

Then forward! O army of Zion,
With hearts that are loyal and brave!
Stand firm by the Cross and its banner,
"And trust in the" Mighty to save!


672
Am I a soldier of the Cross—

Am I a soldier of the Cross—
A follower of the Lamb?
And shall I fear to own His cause,
Or blush to speak His name?

c
In the name, . . . the precious name, . ...
Of Him who died for me.
Through grace I'll win the promised crowns
Whate'er my cross may be.

Must I be carried to the skies
On flowery beds of ease,
While others fought to win the prize
And sailed through bloody seas?

Are there no foes for me to face?
Must I not stem the flood?
Is this vile world a friend to grace,
To help me on to God!

Since I must fight if I would reign,
Increase my courage, Lord!
I'll bear the toil, endure the pain,
Supported by Thy word.


673
Conquering now and still to conquer,

Conquering now and still to conquer,
Rideth a King in His might,
Leading the host of all the faithful
Into the midst of the fight;
See them with courage advancing,
Clad in their brilliant array,
Shouting the name of their Leader,
Hear them exultingly say:

c
"Not to the strong is the battle,
Not to the swift is the race;
Yet to the true and the faithful
Victory is promised through grace."

"Conquering now and still to conquer:
Who is this wonderful King?
Whence all the armies which He leadeth,
While of His glory they sing?
"He is our Lord and Redeemer,
Saviour and Monarch divine;
They are the stars that for ever
Bright in His kingdom will shine.

Conquering now and still to conquer,
Jesus, Thou Ruler of all,
Thrones and their sceptres all shall perish,
Crowns and their splendour shall fall;
Yet shall the armies Thou leadest,
Faithful and true to the last,
Find in Thy mansions eternal
Rest, when their warfare is past.


674
OFT in sorrow, oft in woe,Onward, Christians,

OFT in sorrow, oft in woe,
Onward, Christians, onward go!
Fight the fight, maintain the strife,
Strengthened with the Bread of Life.

Onward, Christians, onward go!
Join the war, and face the foe:
Will ye flee in danger's hour?—
Know ye not your Captain's power?

Let your drooping hearts be glad,
March, in heavenly armour clad:
Fight, nor think the battle long;
Soon shall victory tune your song.

Let not sorrow dim your eye,
Soon shall every tear be dry;
Let not tears your course impede,
Great your strength, if great your need.

Onward then to glory move,
More than conquerors ye shall prove:
Though opposed by many a foe,
Christian soldiers, onward go!

There's a royal banner given for display

There's a royal banner given for display
To the soldiers of the King;
As an ensign fair we lift it up to-day,
While as ransomed ones we sing.

c
Marching on! . . Aiarching on! . .
For Christ count everything but loss; . . .
And to crown Him King, . toil and sing, .
'Neath the banner of the cross!

Though the foe may rage and gather as the flood,
Let the standard be displayed!
And beneath its folds, as soldiers of the Lord,
For the truth be not dismayed!

Over land and sea, wherever man may dwell,
Make the glorious tidings known:
Of the crimson banner now the story tell,
While the Lord shall claim His own!

When the glory dawns—'tis drawing very near;
It is hastening day by day—
Then before our King the foe shall disappear,
And the Cross the world shall sway!

Will victory proclaim!

Gird on the sword and armour!

No enemy can harm thee.

Take courage, temperance workers!

Sail on, . . O ship of hope!
Sail on for truth and right;
The breath of God is in your sails,
The haven is in sight!
The breath of God is in your sails,
The haven is in sight!

Sail on! sail on! deep-freighted
With blessings and with hopes;
The good of old, with shadowy hands,
Are pulling at your ropes;
Behind you, holy martyrs
Uplift the palm and crown;
Before you, unborn ages send
Their benedictions down.

Speed on! your work is holy,
God's errands never fail!
Sweep on through storm and darkness wild,
The thunder and the hail;
Toil on, the morning cometh,
The port you yet shall win!
And all the bells of God shall ring
The" Ship of Temperance" in!

A song, a song for water bright,

A song, a song for water bright,
In love and beauty flowing!
It sings its way in joy and might
The gift of heaven bestowing.

c
A song, a song for water fair,
As pure and free as mountain air!
A song, a song for water fair,
As pure and free as mountain air!

There's balm in every sparkling drop,
In every wave there's pleasure;
In diamond spray it leaps away,
A lovely boon and treasure.

It nerves the hand to deeds of might;
It wakes the heart to gladness;
It breathes a psalm of pure delight,
And charms us all from sadness.

From every vale and glade and hill
It speaks of nature's kindness!
Oh, may we heed the lessons still,
Nor shun it in our blindness!


679
Jesus is calling! Forth to the fray,

Jesus is calling! Forth to the fray,
In line be falling, serve Him to-day!
Follow Him ever, call no retreat!
His soldiers never suffer defeat.

c
On to victory, follow your mighty Commander!
On to victory, follow where Jesus may go!
On to victory, close to your Shield and Defender!
On^to victory, conquering every foe!

He needs you, brother: do thou His will;
Your place no other ever can fill:
Gird on the armour, take up the sword!
Join your Commander, follow your Lord!

Morning is coming, night will be past;
Soon will the dawning break in at last—
Then with the morning, glorious and bright,
Rich crowns adorning victors of light!


680
Stand up! stand up for Jesus!

Stand up! stand up for Jesus!
Ye soldiers of the cross;
Lift high His royal banner,
It must not suffer loss;
From victory unto victory
His army shall He lead,
Till every foe is vanquished,
And Christ is Lord indeed.

Stand up! stand up for Jesus!
The trumpet call obey;
Forth to the mighty conflict
In this His glorious day!
Ye that are men now serve Him,
Against unnumbered foes;
Let courage rise with danger,
And strength to strength oppose.

Stand up! stand up for Jesus!
Stand in His strength alone:
The arm of flesh will fail you—
Ye dare not trust your own:
Put on the gospel armour,
And, watching unto prayer,
Where duty calls, or danger,
Be never wanting there.

Stand up! stand up for Jesus!
The strife will not be long;
This day the noise of battle,
The next the victor's song;
To him that overcometh
A crown of life shall be;
He with the King of glory
Shall reign eternally.

"FAINT, yet pursuing." we press our way

"FAINT, yet pursuing." we press our way
Up to the glorious gates of day;
Following Him who has gone before,
Over the path to the brighter shore.

c
"Faint, yet pursuing, "from day to day,
Over the thorny and blood-marked way;
Strengthen and keep us, O Saviour Friend,
Ever pursuing, unto life's end!

"Faint, yet pursuing, "whate'er befal;
He who has died for us, died for all:
So should they come as a mighty throng,
Bearing His banner aloft with song.

"Faint, yet pursuing, "till eventide,
Under the cross of the Crucified;
Knowing, when darkly are skies o'ercast,
Sorrow and sighing will end at last.

"Faint, yet pursuing, "the eye afar
Sees through the darkness the Morning Star,
Shedding its ray for the weary feet,
Lighting the way to the golden street.


682
Encamped along the hills of light,

Encamped along the hills of light,
Ye Christian soldiers, rise,
And press the battle ere the night
Shall veil the glowing skies;
Against the foe in vales below
Let all our strength be hurled;
Faith is the victory, we know,
That overcomes the world!

c
Faith . Is the victory! Faith . is the victory
Oh, glorious victory, that overcomes the world.

His banner over us is Love,
Our sword, the Word of God;
We tread the road the saints above
With shouts of triumph trod;
By faith they, like a whirlwind's breath,
Swept on o'er every field;
The faith by which they conquered Death
Is still our shining shield.

On every hand the foe we find
Drawn up in dread array;
Let tents of ease be left behind,
And—onward to the fray!
Salvation's helmet on each head,
With truth all girt about,
The earth shall tremble 'neath our tread,
And echo with our shout!

To him that overcomes the foe
White raiment shall be given;
Before the angels he shall know
His name confessed in heaven;
Then onward from the hills of light,
Our hearts with love aflame,
We'll vanquish all the hosts of night,
In Jesus' conquering name!


683
Awake, our souls; away, our fears;

Awake, our souls; away, our fears;
Let every trembling thought be gone;
Awake, and run the heavenly race,
And put a cheerful courage on.

True, 'tis a strait and thorny road,
And mortal spirits tire and faint;
But they forget the mighty God
That feeds the strength ofevery saint—

Thee, mighty God, whose matchless power
Is ever new and ever young,
And firm endures, while endless years
Their everlasting circles run.

From Thee, the overflowing spring,
Our souls shall drink a fresh supply,
While such as trust their native strength
Shall melt away, and droop, and die.

Swift as an eagle cuts the air,
We'll mount aloft to Thine abode;
On wings of love our souls shall fly,
Nor tire amidst the heavenly road.


684
We're soldiers of the King,Redeemed and saved

We're soldiers of the King,
Redeemed and saved by blood,
And now enlisted for the war
To fight for Christ the Lord.
In peril oft are we,
But joyfully we sing,
Our hearts made strong by Him who leads
The soldiers of the King.

c
We're soldiers of the King, ...
His praises we will sing,
And we will serve Him loyally,
our great and glorious King.

We're soldiers of the King,
His Name we gladly bear,
The Name once nailed above the Cross,
When Christ our King was there.
We'll count our losses gain,
And welcome every sting,
To honour our Lord Jesus' name,
As soldiers of the King.

We're soldiers of the King,
With Him we shall appear,
If we with Him shall suffer now,
And His rejection share.
Then lift His banner high,
For time is on the wing,
The crowning day is hastening on
For soldiers of the King.

Firmly stand for God, in the world's mad strife,

Firmly stand for God, in the world's mad strife,
Though the bleak winds roar, and the waves beat high:
*Tis the Rock alone giveth strength and life,
When the hosts of sin are nigh.

c
Let us stand on the Rock! firmly stand on the Rock!
On the Rock of Christ alone:
If the strife we endure, we shall stand secure,
'Mid the throng who surround the throne.

Firmly stand for Right, with a motive pure,
With a true heart bold, and a faith e'er strong;
'Tis the Rock alone giveth triumph sure,
O'er the world's array of wrong.

Firmly stand for Truth! it will serve you best;
Though it waiteth long, it is sure at last;
'Tis the Rock alone giveth peace and rest
When the storms of life are past.

On to victory at the King's command
For the honour of the Lord,
And the triumph of His Word,
In the strength of the Lord firmly stand!

"Be ye strong in the Lord and the power of His might!"
Never turning from the face of the foe;
He will surely by you stand, as you battle for the right:
In the power of His might onward go!

"Be ye strong in the Lord and the power of His might!"
For His promises shall never,never fail:
He will hold thy right hand, while battling for the right,
Trusting Him thou shalt for ever-more prevail.

"Christian, seek not yet repose;

"Christian, seek not yet repose;
Cast thy dreams of ease away,
Thou art in the midst of foes:
"Watch and pray."

Principalities and powers,
Mustering their unseen array,
Wait for thine unguarded hours:
"Watch and pray."

Gird thy heavenly armour on,
Wear it ever night and day;
Ambushed lies the Evil One:
"Watch and pray."

Hear the victors who o'ercame;
Still they mark each warrior's way;
All with one sweet voice exclaim,
"Watch and pray."

Hear, above all, hear thy Lord,
Him thou lovest to obey;
Hide within thy heart His word,
"Watch and pray."

Watch, as if on that alone
Hung the issue of the day;
Pray that help may be sent down:
"Watch and pray."

Sons of earth from slumber waking
Hail the Bright and Morning Star.

Hear the call! Oh, gird your armour on,
Grasp the Spirit's mighty Sword;
Take the Helmet of Salvation,
Pressing on to battle for the Lord!

Trust in Him who is your Captain;
Let no heart in terror quail;
Jesus leads the gathering legions,
In His name we shall prevail.

Onward marching, firm and steady,
Faint not, fear not Satan's frown;
For the Lord is with you alway,
Till you wear the victor's crown.

Conquering hosts with banners waving,
Sweeping on o'er hill and plain,
Ne'er shall halt till swells the anthem
"Christ o'er all the world doth reign!"

Who will hold My banner forward in the fight, . .
'Gainst My foes engaging, stand for God and right?"

Jesus leads His army, 'neath His flag unfurled,
All our foes defeating, right shall sweep the world!


On God's might relying till the victory's won, . .
Satan's host defying, gird our armour on! . .

For God's warfare solely, join we heart and hand!

Give thanks unto God who is ableand willing

Give thanks unto God who is ableand willing
To save to the uttermost all who draw near;
To send out His light, their redemption fulfilling,
While His wonderful love shall dispel every fear.

Arise! . . arise! . . Arise, for thy light is come .
Arise! . . arise! . . Arise, for thy light is come!
The light ... of truth . . to lead . . . thee home; ...
Arise! oh, arise! for thy light is come!

Sweet hope in the home of the drunkard hath risen,
Where the darkness of sorrow too long held its reign;
He hath cast off his fetters, and burst from his prison,
And the sunshine of joy fills his heart once again.

Then banish the wine-cup, and seek for a blessing
From Him in whose might you alone can prevail:
For they who will seek Him, their weakness confessing,
Shall have strength to resist all the foes who assail.

What though th' accuser roar

What though th' accuser roar
Of ills that I have done;
I know them well, and thousands more;
Jehovah findeth none.

His be the Victor's name
Who fought our fight alone;
Triumphant saints no honour claim;
Their conquest was His own.

By weakness and defeat,
He won the meed and crown;
Trod all our foes beneath His feet,
By being trodden down.

He hell in hell laid low;
Made sin, He sin o'erthrew;
Bowed to the grave, destroyed it so,
And death, by dying, slew.

Bless, bless the Conqueror slain!
Slain by Divine decree!
Who lived, who died, who lives again,
For thee, His saint, for thee.


692
Trust on, trust on, believer!

Trust on, trust on, believer!
Though long the conflict be,
Thou yet shall prove victorious;
Thy God shall tight for thee.

c
Trust on! ... trust on! ...
Though dark the night and drear:
Trust on! ... trust on! ...
The morning dawn is near.

Trust on! the danger presses,
Temptation strong is near;
Over life's dangerous rapids
He shall thy passage steer.

The Lord is strong to save us,
He is a faithful friend:
Trust on, trust on, believer!
Oh, trust Him to the end!


693
Onward! upward! Christian soldier,

Onward! upward! Christian soldier,
Turn not back nor sheath thy sword:
Let its blade be sharp for conquest
In the battle for the Lord.
From the great white throne eternal,
God Himself is looking down;
He it is who now commands thee,
Take the cross and win the crown.

Onward! upward! doing, daring
All for Him who died for thee;
Face the foe and meet with boldness
Danger, whatsoe'er it be.
From the battlements of glory,
Holy ones are looking down;
Thou canst almost hear them shouting:
"On! let no one take thy crown."

Onward! till thy course is finished,
Like the ransomed ones before;
Keep the faith through persecution,
Never give the battle o'er.
Onward! upward! till victorious
Thou shalt lay thine armour down,
And thy loving Saviour bids thee
At His hand receive thy crown.

We're marching to Canaan with banner and song,

We're marching to Canaan with banner and song,
We're soldiers enlisted to fight 'gainst the wrong;
But, lest in the conflict our strength should divide,
We ask, Who among us is on the Lord's side?

c
Oh,, who is there among us,
The true and the tried,
Who'll stand by his colours?
Who's on the Lord's side?

The sword may be burnished, the armour be bright,
For Satan appears as an angel of light;
Yet darkly the bosom may treachery hide,
While lips are professing,"I'm on the Lord's side."

Who is there among us yet under the rod,
Who knows not the pardoning mercy of God!
Oh, bring to Him humbly the heart in its pride;
Oh, haste while He's waiting, and seek the Lord's side.

Oh, heed not the sorrow, the pain, or the wrong,
For soon shall our sighing be changed into song;
So, bearing the cross of our covenant Guide,
We'll shout, as we triumph, "I'm on the Lord's side."'


695
The Son of God goes forth to war,

The Son of God goes forth to war,
A kingly crown to gain;
His blood-red banner streams afar,
Who follows in His train?
Who best can drink His cup of woe,
Triumphant over pain;
Who patient bears his cross below,
He follows in His train.

The martyr first, whose eagle eye
Could pierce beyond the grave:
Who saw his Master in the sky,
And called on Him to save:
Like Him, with pardon on his tongue,
In midst of mortal pain,
He prayed for them that did the wrong:
Who follows in his train?

A glorious band, the chosen few,
On whom the Spirit came:
Twelve valiant saints, their hope they knew,
And mocked the cross and flame.
They met the tyrant's brandished steel,
The lion's gory mane;
They bowed their necks the death to feel:
Who follows in their train?

A noble army—men and boys
The matron and the maid—
Around the Saviour's throne rejoice,
In robes of light arrayed,
They climbed the steep ascent of heaven
Through peril, toil, and pain:
O God, to us may grace be given
To follow in their train.


696
Only an armour-bearer, firmly I stand,

Only an armour-bearer, firmly I stand,
Waiting to follow at the King's command;
Marching, if" Onward" shall the order be,
Standing by my Captain, serving faithfully.

c
Hear ye the battle-cry!" Forward!" the call;
See, see, the faltering ones, backward they fall.
Surely my Captain may depend on me,
Though but an armour-bearer I may be.

Only an armour-bearer, now in the field,
Guarding a shining helmet, sword, and shield,
Waiting to hear the thrilling battle cry,
"Ready then to answer, "Master, here am I.

Only an armour-bearer, yet may I share
Glory immortal, and a bright crown wear:
If in the battle to my trust I'm true,
Mine shall be the honours in the Grand Review.


697
Mine eyes have seen the glory

Mine eyes have seen the glory of the
coming of the Lord;
He is trampling out the vintage where
the grapes of wrath are stored;
He hath loosed the fateful lightning
of His terrible, swift sword:
Our God is marching on.

Glory! glory! Hallelujah!
Glory! glory! Hallelujah!
Glory! glory! Hallelujah!
Our God is marching on.

I have seen Him in the watch-fires
of a hundred circling camps;
They have builded Him an altar in
the evening dews and damps;
I can read His righteous sentence by
the dim and flaring lamps:
Our God is marching on.

He has sounded forth the trumpet
that shall never call retreat;
He is sifting out the hearts of men
before His judgment-seat:
Oh, be swift, my soul, to answer
Him! be jubilant, my feet!
Our God is marching on.

In the beauty of the lilies, Christ was
born across the sea,
With a glory in His bosom that
transfigures you and me:
As He died to make men holy, let us
die to make men free,
While God is marching on.


698
Yield not to temptation, for yielding is sin,

Yield not to temptation, for yielding is sin,
Each victory will help you some other to win;
Fight manfully onward, dark passions subdue,
Look ever to Jesus, He'll carry you through.

c
Ask the Saviour to help you,
Comfort, strengthen, and keep y&u;
He is willing to aid you,
He will carry you through.

Shun evil companions, bad language disdain,
God's name hold in reverence, nor take it in vain:
Be thoughtful and earnest, kind hearted and true;
Look ever to Jesus, He'll carry you through.

To him that o'ercometh God giveth a crown;
Through faith we shall conquer,
though often cast down;
He who is our Saviour our strength will renew;
Look ever to Jesus, He'll carry you through.

O BROTHER, life's journey beginning,

O BROTHER, life's journey beginning,
With courage and firmness arise!—
Look well to the course thou art choosing;
Be earnest, be watchful, and wise!
Remember—two paths are before thee,
And both thy attention invite;
But one leadeth on to destruction,
The other to joy and delight.

c
God help you to follow His banner,
And serve Him wherever you go;
And when you are tempted, my brother,
God give you the grace to say" No!"

O brother, yield not to the tempter,
No matter what others may do;
Stand firm in the strength of the Master,
Be loyal, be faithful, and tme!
Each trial will make you the stronger,
If you, in the name of the Lord,
Fight manfully under your Leader,
Obeying the voice of His word.

O brother* the Saviour is calling!
Beware of the danger of sin;
Resist not the voice of the Spirit,
That whispers so gently within.
God calls you to enter His service—
To live for Him here, day by day;
And share by and by in the glory
That never shall vanish away.

Hark! the temperance bells are ringing,

Hark! the temperance bells are ringing,
Joyous music fills the air;
Strength and hope their tones are bringing
To the homes where dwelt despair.

c
Hear the bells, ... joyous bells, ...
Chime the anthem of the free;
Hear the bells, ... merry bells, ...
Sound the temperance jubilee!

Long the tyrant foe hath taken
Cherished loved ones for his own;
Now his cruel power is shaken,
Soon will fall his tottering throne.

Brothers, come! the hosts are forming!
Let us join without delay;
Bright the hills with tints of morning,
Dawning of a better day.

Down from the mountains a gay little stream,

Down from the mountains a gay little stream,
Leaping along, leaping along,
Sang a sweet tune to the sun's merry beam,
Leaping along, along.

c
Murmuring stream, murmuring stream,
Flow to the rolling sea;
Murmuring stream, murmuring stream,
Singing of purity.

Cooling the grass in the long summer hours,
Smiling along, smiling along;
Giving a drink to the birds and the
Smiling along, along.

Wider and wider as onward you flow,flowers,
Rippling along, rippling along;
Carry a blessing wherever you go,
Rippling along, along.

Bright little streamlets we children may be,
Singing along, singing along,
Loving and helpful, pure-hearted and free,
Singing along, along.

Long in darkness we have waited

Long in darkness we have waited
For the shining of the Light;
Long have felt the things we hated
Sink us still in deeper night.

c
Blessed Jesus, loving Saviour!
Tender, faithful, strong, and true,
Break the fetters that have bound us,
Make us in Thyself anew!

Now, at last, the Light appeareth,
Jesus stands upon the shore;
And with tender voice He calleth,
"Come to Me, and sin no more!"

Nothing have we but our weakness,
Naught but sorrow, sin, and care;
All within is loathsome vileness,
All without is dark despair.

All our talents we have wasted,
All Thy laws have disobeyed;
But Thy goodness now we've tasted,
In Thy robes we stand arrayed.

Thou hast saved us—do Thou keep us,
Guide us by Thine eye divine;
Let the Holy Spirit teach us,
That our light may ever shine.

c
Blessed Jesus, be Thou near us,
Give us of Thy grace to-day;
While we're calling, do Thou hear us,
Send us now Thy peace, we pray.

Sound the battle-cry! See! the foe is nigh;

Sound the battle-cry! See! the foe is nigh;
Raise the standard high for the Lord!
Gird your armour on, stand firm every one,
Rest your cause upon His holy Word!

c
Rouse then, soldiers! rally round the banner!
Ready, steady, pass the word along;
Onward I forward! shout aloud Hosanna!
Christ is Captain of the mighty throng!

Strong to meet the foe, marching on we go,
While our cause we know must prevail;
Shield and banner bright gleaming in the light,
Battling for the right, we ne'er can fail!

O Thou God of all, hear us when we call;
Help us one and all, by Thy grace;
When the battle's done, and the victory won,
May we wear the crown before Thy face!

Christian, dost thou see them on the holy ground,

Christian, dost thou see them on the holy ground,
How the powers of darkness compass thee around?
Christian, up and smite them, counting gain but loss;
Smite them by the merit of the holy cross.

Christian, dost thou feel them, how they work within,
[Striving, tempting, luring, goading into sin?
Christian, never tremble, never be downcast;
Gird thee for the conflict, watch and pray and fast.

Christian, dost thou hear them, how they speak thee fair?
"Always fast and vigil, always watch and prayer?"
Christian, answer boldly, "While I ' breathe I pray";
Peace shall follow battle, night shall end in day.

"Well I know thy trouble, O My servant true;
Thou art very weary—I was weary too:
But that toil shall make thee some day all Mine own,
And the end of sorrow shall be near My throne."

Listen to the strains inspiring,
Tis a message for us all.

Fall into line for the conflict!
Fall into line for the conflict!
Rally at the trumpet's call, rally! rally!
Rally, Christian soldiers all!

Girding on the royal armour,
Wave the glorious banner high!
While for truth and right contending,
Angels watch you from the sky.

Sound again the silver trumpet!
Sound aloud the battle-cry!
"All for Jesus, all for Jesus!
"We shall conquer though we die!

Onward, Christian soldiers! marching as to war,

Onward, Christian soldiers! marching as to war,
Looking unto Jesus, who is gone before.
Christ, the Royal Master, leads against the foe;
Forward into battle see His banners go.

c
Onward, Christian soldiers! marching as to war.
Looking unto Jesus, who is gone before.

At the name of Jesus Satan's host doth flee;
On then, Christian soldiers, on to victory!
Hell's foundations quiver at the shout of praise:
Brothers, lift your voices, loud your anthems raise!

Like a mighty army moves the church of God:
Brothers, we are treading where the saints have trod;
We are not divided, all one body we—
One in hope and doctrine, one in charity.

Crowns and thrones may perish, kingdoms rise and wane;
But the church of Jesus constant will remain:
Gates of hell can never 'gainst that church prevail;
We have Christ's own promise and that cannot fail.

Onward then, ye people, join our happy throng:
Blend with ours your voices in the triumph-song:
Glory, praise, and honour, unto Christ the King,
This through countless ages men and angels sing.

Heeding God's command,
Honour them, the faithful few!
All hail to Daniel's Band!

c
Dare to be a Daniel!
Dare to stand alone!
Dare to have a purpose firm!
Dare to make it known!

Many mighty men are lost,
Daring not to stand,
Who for God had been a host,
By joining Daniel's Band!

Many giants, great and tall,
Stalking through the land,
Headlong to the earth would fall,
If met by Daniel's Band!

Hold the gospel banner high!
On to victory grand!
Satan and his host defy,
And shout for Daniel's Band!

We will not despair, Though storms

We will not despair,
Though storms our bark may sever;
Knowing everywhere,
Jehovah can deliver!

When in death's dark vale,
By Jordan's rolling river,
Earthly helpers fail,
Jehovah must deliver!

Oh, let come what will,
We'll trust our faithful Giver;
And our song is still—
Jehovah will deliver!

O troubled heart, be thou not afraid,

O troubled heart, be thou not afraid,
In the Lord thy God let thy hope be stayed;
He will hear thy cry, and will give thee aid,
Whate'er thy cross may be.

c
He is able still to deliver thee,
And His own right hand thy defence shall be:
 He is able still to deliver thee,
Then be thou not afraid.

O troubled heart, though thy foes unite,
Let thy faith be strong and thy armour bright;
Thou shalt overcome through His power and might.
And more than conqueror be.

O troubled heart, when thy way is drear,
He will rescue thee and dispel thy fear;
In thy greatest need He is always near—
To Him all glory be!

O weary heart, there is a Home,

O weary heart, there is a Home,
Beyond the reach of toil and care;
A Home where changes never come:
Who would not fain be resting there?

c
Oh wait, . . . meekly wait, and murmur not!
Oh wait, . . meekly wait, and murmur not!
Oh wait, ... oh wait, . . .
Oh wait, and murmur not! . . .

Yet when bowed down beneath the load
By heaven allowed, thine earthly lot;
Look up! thou'lt reach that blest abode:
Wait, meekly wait, and murmur not!

If in thy path some thorns are found,
Oh, think who bore them on His brow;
If grief thy sorrowing heart has found,
It reached a holier than thou.

Toil on! nor deem, though sore it be,
One sigh unheard, one prayer forgot;
The day of rest will dawn for thee:
Wait, meekly wait, and murmur not!

What though clouds are hovering o'er me,

What though clouds are hovering o'er me,
And I seem to walk alone—
Longing, 'mid my cares and crosses,
For the joys that now are flown!
If I've Jesus, "Jesus only,"
Then my sky will have a gem;
He's the Sun of brightest splendour,
And the Star of Bethlehem.

What though all my earthly journey
Bringeth naught but weary hours;
And, in grasping for life's roses.,
Thorns I find instead of flowers!
If I've Jesus, "Jesus only,"
I possess a cluster rare;
He's the" Lily of the Valley,"
And the" Rose of Sharon" fair.

What though all my heart is yearning
For the loved of long ago—
Bitter lessons sadly learning
From the shadowy page of woe!
If I've Jesus, "Jesus only,"
He'll be with me to the end;
And, unseen by mortal vision,
Angel bands will o'er me bend.

When I soar to realms of glory,
And an entrance I await,
If I whisper, "Jesus only!"
Wide will ope the pearly gate;
When I join the heavenly chorus,
And the angel-hosts I see,
Precious Jesus, "Jesus only,"
Will my theme of rapture be.

O child of God, wait patiently,

O child of God, wait patiently,
When dark thy path may be;
And let thy faith lean trustingly
On Him who cares for thee;
And though the clouds hang drearily
Upon the brow of night,
Yet in the morning joy will come,
And fill thy soul with light.

O child of God, He loveth thee,
And thou art all His own;
With gentle hand He leadeth thee—
Thou dost not walk alone;
And though thou watchest wearily
The long and stormy night,
Yet in the morning joy will come,
And fill thy soul with light.

O child of God, how peacefully
He calms thy fears to rest;
And draws thee upward, tenderly,
Where dwell the pure and blest!
And He who bendeth silently
Above the gloom of night,
Will take thee home, where endless joy
Shall fill thy soul with light.


713
Be still, O heart! why fear and tremble?

Be still, O heart! why fear and tremble?
What evil can thy steps betide?
Though foes, a mighty host, assemble,
Fear not, for God is on thy side.

c
Be still, . . O heart! . .
What evil can betide thee?
Fear not, . . fear not, . .
With God to walk beside thee.

Be still, O heart! the Lord of glory
Was once a man acquaint with grief;
He stoops to hear—tell all thy story—
He loves, He cares, He'll send relief.

Be still, O heart! cease fearing, fretting
About the future all unknown;
Ne'er think the Master is forgetting
About His child—His loved and own.

Be still, O heart! thy Lord will send thee
The clouds or sunshine as is best;
His own right hand shall e'er defend thee;
Then trust His love, and be at rest.


714
O aching heart, with sorrow torn,

O aching heart, with sorrow torn,
Thy Lord is near and knows!
He knows it all—the feet way-worn,
The weary cares and woes,
The load of grief in anguish borne,
Thy Lord is near: ... He knows.

c
He knows, . . He knows; . .
Thy Lord is near: He knows.

O fainting soul, with doubts oppressed,
Thy Lord is near and knows!
He knows it all—how thou art pressed
On every side with foes,
He waits to be thy cherished Guest;
Thy Lord is near: ... He knows.

O weary head, that fain would rest,
Thy Lord is near and knows!
He knows it all, and on His breast
Thou raayest now repose;
Drop every care at His behest;
Thy Lord is near: He knows.

O lonely one, live thou thy best,
Thy Lord is near and knows!
He knows it all, sees every test—
Yes, every tear that flows:
Rejoice, faint heart, His way is best;
Thy Lord is near: He knows.


715
Hope on, hope on, O troubled heart!

Hope on, hope on, O troubled heart!
If doubts and fears o'ertake thee,
Remember this—the Lord hath said,
He" never will forsake thee."
Then murmur not, still bear thy lot,
Nor yield to care or sorrow;
Be sure the clouds that frown to-day
Will break in smiles to-morrow.

Hope on, hope on! though dark and deep
The shadows gather o'er thee;
Be not dismayed: thy Saviour holds
The Lamp of Life before thee.
And if He will that thou to-day
Shouldst tread the vale of sorrow,
Be not afraid; but trust and wait—
The sun will shine to-morrow.

Hope on, hope on! go bravely forth,
Through trial and temptation;
Directed by the Word of truth,
So full of consolation.
There is a calm for every storm;
A joy for every sorrow;
A night from which the soul shall wake
To hail an endless morrow.


716
O troubled heart, there is a balm

O troubled heart, there is a balm
To heal thy every wound!
In thy Redeemer's bleeding side
That balm alone is found.
The hidden anguish of the soul,
The burning tears that fall,
The sigh that rends thy aching breast—
Thy Saviour knows them all.

Go where no ear but His can hear,
No eye but His can see;
Has He not said that as thy day
E'en so thy strength shall be?
Though heaven and earth should pass away,
His Word can never fail,
If thou by faith approach His throne,
By faith thou shalt prevail.

Then why cast down? these passing ills,
Thy path that sometimes dim,
Will work together for tliy good
If thou but trust in Him:
The many blessings of the past
With gratitude recall;
Then tell thy sorrows at the feet
Of Him who knows them all.


717
Oh, weary pilgrim, lift your head:

Oh, weary pilgrim, lift your head:
For joy cometh in the morning!
For God in His own Word hath said
That joy cometh in the morning!

c
Joy cometh in the morning!
Joy cometh in the morning!
Weeping may endure for a night;
But joy cometh hi the morning!

Ye trembling saints, dismiss your fears:
For joy cometh in the morning!
Oh, weary mourner, dry your tears:
For joy cometh in the morning!

Rejoice! the night will soon be gone:
For joy cometh in the morning!
And then shall come the glorious dawn:
For joy cometh in the morning!

Oh, may we all be glad to-day!
For joy cometh in the morning!
Our God shall wipe all tears away:
For joy cometh in the morning!


718
My God, my Father, while I stray

My God, my Father, while I stray
tar from my home, on life's rough way,
Oh, teach me from my heart to say,
"Thy will be done!"

c
Thy will be done!
Thy will be done!
Oh, teach me from my heart to say,
"Thy will be done!"

What though in lonely grief I sigh
For friends beloved, no longer nigh,
Submissive still would I reply,
"Thy will be done!"

Let but my fainting heart be blest
With Thy sweet Spirit for its guest,
My God, to Thee I leave the rest:
"Thy will be done!"

Renew my will from day to day:
Blend it with Thine; and take away
All now that makes it hard to say,
"Thy will be done!"

Then when on earth I breathe no more
The prayer oft mixed with tears before,
I'll sing upon a happier shore,
"Thy will be done!"


719
Come, ye disconsolate! where'er ye languish,

Come, ye disconsolate! where'er ye languish,
Come to the mercy-seat, fervently kneel:
Here bring your wounded hearts, here tell your anguish;
Earth has no sorrow that heaven cannot heal.

Joy of the desolate! light of the straying,
Hope of the penitent, fadeless and pure!
Here speaks the Comforter, tenderly saying,
Earth has no sorrow that heaven cannot cure.

Here see the Bread of Life! see waters flowing
Forth from the throne of God, pure from above:
Come to the feast of love; come, ever knowing,
Earth has no sorrow but heaven can remove.


720
Night has fallen on the city,

Night has fallen on the city,
And the streets at last are still,
Where the noisy crowd, the day long,
Did the air with shoutings fill;
And the weary, way-worn travellers,
Preaching Jesus through the land,
Are in deepest dungeon darkness,
By the magistrates' command.

Many stripes to them are given,
Many curses on them cast;
Many bolts and bars surround them;
In the stocks their feet are fast;
While the cruel Roman jailer,
All securely sleeping on,
Little dreams the mighty wonders
Of the morrow's early dawn.

Hark the sighing of the prisoners!
Hear their moanings loud and long!
No: again, and louder, clearer,
'Tis the voice of prayer and song!
See, the prison walls are shaking,
And the door wide open stands!
Lo, behold the earth is quaking,
Loosed are every prisoner's bands!

Oh, there's not a cell so lonely
But a song may echo there;
Oh, there's not a night so cheerless,
But there's potency in prayer;
Sing, oh, sing, thou weary pilgrim!
Song will bring thee heavenly peace;
Pray, oh, pray, thou burdened prisoner!
God will give thee sweet release.


721
O eyes that are weary and hearts that are sore,

O eyes that are weary and hearts that are sore,
Look off unto Jesus, and sorrow no more;
The light of His countenance shineth so bright,
That on earth as in heaven there need be no night.

Looking off unto Jesus, my eyes cannot see
The troubles and dangers that throng around me;
They cannot be blinded with sorrowful tears;
They cannot be shadowed with unbelief-fears.

Looking off unto Jesus, my spirit is blest;
In the world I have turmoil, in Him I have rest;
The sea of my life all about me may roar;
When I look unto Jesus, I hear it no more.

Looking off unto Jesus, I go not astray;
My eyes are on Him, and He shows me the way;
The path may seem dark as He leads me along,
But following Jesus I cannot go wrong.


722
How oft our souls are lifted up,

How oft our souls are lifted up,
When clouds are dark and drear;
For Jesus comes, and kindly speaks
These loving words of cheer:

c
"In My Father's house are many mansions;
If it were not so, I would have told you;
In My Father's house are many mansions,
I go to prepare a place for you!"

How oft amid our daily toil,
With anxious care opprest,
We hear again the precious word
That tells of joy and rest:

Oh, may our faith in Him be strong,
Who feels our every care,
And will for us—as He hath said—
A place in heaven prepare!

Then let us work, and watch, and pray,
Relying on the love
Of Him who now prepares a place
For us in heaven above.


723
Sometimes a light surprises

Sometimes a light surprises
The Christian while he sings;
It is the Lord who rises
With healing in His wings.
When comforts are declining,
He grants the soul again
A season of clear shining,
To cheer it after rain.

In holy contemplation,
We sweetly then pursue
The theme of God's salvation,
And find it ever new;
Set free from present sorrow,
We cheerfully can say—
E'en let th' unknown to-morrow
Bring with it what it may:

It can bring with it nothing
But He will bear us through;
Who gives the lilies clothing,
Will clothe His people too:
Beneath the spreading heavens
No creature but is fed;
And He who feeds the ravens
Will give His children bread.

Though vine nor fig tree neither
Their wonted fruit should bear;
Though all the fields should wither,
Nor flocks nor herds be there:
Yet God the same abiding,
His praise shall tune my voice;
For, while in Him confiding,
I cannot but rejoice.


724
How dear to my heart, when the pathway is lonely,

How dear to my heart, when the pathway is lonely,
That wonderful promise of Jesus my Lord—
That message of mercy, of love and compassion,
I read on the page of His own blessed Word.

c
"Fear not I am with thee, "thy strength and Redeemer,
The Rock where in safety My own shall abide;
I'll never forsake thee—My Word hath declared it;
I'll never forsake thee, whatever betide.

When chilled by the waves that are surging around me,
And clouds of affliction like billows may roll,
I'll cling to His word, which can never be broken,
And joy in the comfrot it brings to my soul.

Though tried in the furnace, my faith shall not falter,
But, trusting in Jesus, the cross I will bear;
And hoping, enduring, believing, obeying,
I'll cling to His promise, and rest in His care.


725
Where'er my Father's hand may guide me,

Where'er my Father's hand may guide me,
All, all is well!
With Jesus walking still beside me,
All, all is well!
Though shadows gather darkly o'er me,
Still His love I'll tell;
He trod the path of tears before me,
All, all is well!
He trod the path of tears before me:
All, all is well!

Though what I ask He oft denies me,
All, all is well!
With what I need His grace supplies me,
All, all is well!
Thro' joy or grief, thro' pain or pleasure.
Still His love I'll tell;
He is my soul's eternal treasure:
All, all is well!

Though round my bark life's storms
All, all is well!
I hear my Saviour's voice repeating,are beating,
All, all is well!
And when I come to Jordan's river,
Still His love I'll tell;
And shout, while safely passing over,
"All, all is well!"


726
Peace! perfect peace! in this dark world of sin?

Peace! perfect peace! in this dark world of sin?
The blood of Jesus whispers peace within.

Peace! perfect peace! by thronging duties prest?
To do the will of Jesus, this is rest.

Peace! perfect peace! with sorrows surging round?
On Jesus" bosom naught but calm is found.

Peace! perfect peace! with loved ones far away?
In Jesus' keeping we are safe, and they.

Peace! perfect peace! our future all unknown?
Jesus we know, and He is on the throne.

Peace! perfect peace! death shadowing us and ours?
Jesus has vanquished death and all its powers.

It is enough: earth's struggles soon shall cease,
And Jesus call to heaven's perfect peace.


727
"Let not your heart be troubled;"

"Let not your heart be troubled;"
Rest in the Lord your King;
Not without hope your weeping;
Those who in Christ are sleeping
He in the clouds will bring.

c
"Wherefore comfort ye, comfort ye one another, .
Comfort ye, comfort ye, comfort ye with these words! ...
Whereore comfort ye, comfort ye one another, .
Comfort ye one another, . with these words." . .

"Let not your heart be troubled;"
If ye on Christ believe,
Joy for each night of sorrow,
Life, and a bright to-morrow,
Ye shall from Him receive.

Watch, for the Lord is coming;
Watch, for the time draws near;
He by His saints attended,
Ke that to heaven ascended,
Soon will again appear.


728
Weary of wandering long, my sore heart saith;

Weary of wandering long, my sore heart saith;
"Show me Thy way, O Lord! teach me Thy path!"
I thought these weary feet straight behind.
way would find
All rough and rugged paths left far

But as I onward passed, the way grew steep;
And black clouds gathered fast, and skies did weep;
And darkness seemed to hide the toilsome road:
"Amazed, again I cried, "Thy way, O God?

"A lamp unto my feet" God's Word did prove;
A"still, small voice, "and sweet,spoke thus in love:
"Whoso, through night and day, God's way pursues,
' Him shall He teach the way that He shall choose.'"

Then, since He chose for me this rugged path,
My hand in His shall be with steadfast faith;
Each step this darksome night is bringing me
Still nearer to the bright eternity.


729
We may not climb the heavenly steep:?

We may not climb the heavenly steep:?
To bring the Lord Christ down:
In vain we search the lowest deeps,
For Him no depths can drown.

But warm, sweet, tender, even yet
A present help is He;
And faith has still its Olivet,
And love its Galilee.

The healing of Hh seamless dress
Is by our beds of pain;
We touch Him in life's throng and press,
And we are whole again.

O Lord and Master of us all,
Whate'er our name or sign,
We own Thy sway, we hear Thy call.
We test our lives by Thine!


730
Calm me, my God, and keep me calm;

Calm me, my God, and keep me calm;
Let Thine outstretched wing
Be like the shade of Elim's palm,
Beside her desert-spring.

Yes, keep me calm, though loud and rude
The sounds my ear that greet—
Calm in the closet's solitude,
Calm in the bustling street:

Cairn in the hour of buoyant health,
Calm in my hour of pain;
Calm in my poverty or wealth,
Calm in my loss or gain;

Calm in the sufferance of wrong,
Like Him who bore my shame;
Calm 'mid the threatening, taunting throng,
Who hate Thy holy name,

Calm me, my God, and keep me calm,
Soft resting on Thy breast;
Soothe me with holy hymn and psalm,
And bid my spirit rest.


731
Beyond our sight a city foursquare lieth,

Beyond our sight a city foursquare lieth,
Above the clouds, the fogs and mists of earth;
And none but souls that Jesus purifieth
Can see its walls, or hear its holy mirth.

c
Beyond our sight, . . . beyond our night, . . .
Beyond this world's sad story;
That city bright, ... it stands in light, . . .
The home of all the holy.

Secure and strong, this heavenly city builded
By Christ the Lamb for all the blood-washed throng,
Gleams fair and bright, with golden glory gilded,
For ever thrilling with triumphant song.

There, on the throne, the Lamb once slain is seated,
The Shepherd's joy upon His holy face;
While countless hosts, their warfare all completed,
In circling bands, lift ceaseless songs of praise.

O sorrowing souls, beneath earth's burdens bending,
Lift up your eyes to yonder city fair;
And through your tears let praise be still ascending,
For rest, and home, and loved ones waiting there.


732
Rest in the Lord, O weary, heavy laden!

Rest in the Lord, O weary, heavy laden!
Look unto Him, your ever-present Guide:
Rest in the Lord, whose Word is truth eternal;
Leave all to Him, whatever may betide.

Rest in the Lord, and tell Him all your sorrow;
Trust in His love, so boundless, full, and free;
He will not leave, nor will He e'er forsake you;
Rest in the Lord, and sweet your rest shall be.

Rest in the Lord, and when your toil is over,
When every storm and danger you have passed—
Lo! He has said, whose Word abideth ever,
You shall receive His welcome home at last.


733
"Only a beam of sunshine"—But oh, it was warm

"Only a beam of sunshine"—
But oh, it was warm and bright;
The heart of a weary traveller
Was cheered by its welcome sight.
"Only a beam of sunshine"
That fell from the arch above:
And tenderly, softly whispered
A message of peace and love.

c
Only a word for Jesus—
Only a whispered prayer—
Over some grief-worn spirit
May rest like a sunbeam fair!

"Only a beam of sunshine"
That into a dwelling crept;
Where, over a fading rosebud,
A mother her vigil kept.
"Only a beam of sunshine"
That smiled through her falling tears,
And showed her the bow of promise,
Forgotten perhaps for years.

Only a word for Jesus,
Oh, speak it in His dear name;
To perishing souls around you
The message of love proclaim.
Go, like the faithful sunbeam,
Your mission of joy fulfil;
Remember the Saviour's promise—
That He will be with you still.


734
On the mountain's top appearing,

On the mountain's top appearing,
Lo! the sacred herald stands,
Welcome news to Zion bearing—
Zion, long in hostile lands:
Mourning captive,
God Himself will loose thy bands.

Has thy night been long and mournful?
Have thy friends unfaithful proved?
Have thy foes been proud and scornful,
By thy sighs and tears unmoved?
Cease thy mourning,
Zion still is well beloved.

God, thy God, will now restore thee;
He Himself appears thy Friend:
All thy foes shall flee before thee,
Here their boasts and triumphs end;
Great deliverance
Zion's King shall surely send.

Enemies no more shall trouble,
AH thy wrongs shall be redressed;
For thy shame thou shalt have double,
In thy Maker's favour blessed:
All thy conflicts
End in everlasting rest.


735
There is never a day so dreary,

There is never a day so dreary,
But God can make it bright;
And unto the soul that trusts Him,
He giveth songs in the night.
There is never a path so hidden,
But God will lead the way,
If we seek for the Spirit's guidance,
And patiently wait and pray;
If we seek for the Spirit's guidance,
And patiently wait and pray.

There is never a cross so heavy,
But the nail-scarred hands are there,
Outstretched in tender compassion,
The burden to help us bear.
There is never a heart so broken,
But the loving Lord can heal;
For the heart that was pierced on Calvary,
Does still for His loved ones feel.

There is never a life so darkened,
So hopeless and unblest,
But may be filled with the light of God,
And enter His promised rest.
There is never a sin or sorrow,
There is never a care or loss,
But that we may bring to Jesus,
And leave at the foot of the cross.


736
When our heads are bowed with woe,

When our heads are bowed with woe,
When our bitter tears o'erflow,
When we mourn the lost, the dear—
Jesus, Son of David, hear!

Thou our feeble flesh hast worn,
Thou our mortal griefs hast borne;
Thou hast shed the human tear:
Jesus, Son of David, hear!

When the heart is sad within,
With the thought of all its sin;
When the spirit shrinks with fear;
Jesus, Son of David, hear!

Thou the shame, the grief, hast known;
Though the sins were not Thine own,
Thou hast deigned their load to bear:
Jesus, Son of David, hear!

When our eyes grow dim in death,
When we heave the parting breath,
When our solemn doom is near—
Jesus, Son of David, hear!

Thou hast bowed the dying head;
Thou the blood of life hast shed;
Thou hast filled a mortal bier:
Jesus, Son of David, hear!


737
Quiet, Lord, my froward heart;

Quiet, Lord, my froward heart;
Make me teachable and mild,
Upright, simple, free from art;
Make me as a little child—
From distrust and envy free,
Pleased with all that pleases Thee.

What Thou shalt to-day provide,
Let me as a child receive;
What to-morrow may betide,
Calmly to Thy wisdom leave:
Tis enough that Thou wilt care—
Why should I the burden bear?

As a little child relies
On a care beyond his own,
Knows he's neither strong nor wise,
Fears to stir a step alone—
Let me thus with Thee abide,
As my Father, Guard, and Guide!


738
Come un^o Me, ye weary,

Come un^o Me, ye weary,
Sorrowing ones oppressed;
I am your tender Shepherd,
Waiting to give you rest.

c
Come, come, come unto Me,
Weary and sore distressed
Come, come, come unto Me,
Come unto Me and rest.

Come unto Me, ye weary:
List to the voice so dear,
Sweeter than angel music
Falling upon the ear.

Come unto Me, ye weary:
List to that voice again,
Over the barren mountain,
Over the lonely plain.

Come unto Me, ye weary:
Why will ye longer roam?
Come to the arms of mercy,
Come to a Father's home.


739
Thou art my great" Physician,"

Thou art my great" Physician,"
My Saviour and my All;
I look to Thee for blessing,
And on Thy mercy call.
With tenderest care Thou watchest
Beside the couch of pain,
And givest health and healing,
When human help is vain.

When in the midnight watches,
With anxious care oppressed,
I often hear Thee whisper,
"Come unto Me and rest."
Thou carest for the weary,
Dost mark the sparrow's fall:
Then surely I can trust Thee,
Thou art my" All in All."

Thou art my" Tower of Refuge,"
My" Strength" upon the way;
My ** Hope" of endless glory,
When ends life's fleeting day!
Thou art the only" Healer"
For body, mind, and soul,
And when all others fail me,
Thy touch can make me whole.

Thou art my" Resurrection"
To life that never dies,
Where Thou art now preparing
A mansion in the skies:
Then hasten Thine appearing,
To take Thy people home,
Where sickness, pain, and sorrow,
Shall never, never come.


740
Not now, but in the coming years—

Not now, but in the coming years—
It may be in the better land—
We'll read the meaning of our tears,
And there, some time, we'll understand.

c
Then trust in God through all thy days;
Fear not! for He doth hold thy hand; . .
Though dark thy way, still sing and praise;
Some time, some time we'll understand.

We'll catch the broken threads again,
And finish what we here began;
Heaven will the mysteries explain,
And then, ah then, we'll understand.

We'll know why clouds instead of sun
Were over many a cherished plan;
Why song has ceased when scarce begun;
Tis there,- some time, we'll understand.

Why, what we long for most of all,
Eludes so oft our eager hand;
Why hopes are crushed, and castles fall,
Up there, some time, we'll understand.

God knows the way, He holds the key,
He guides us with unerring hand;
Some time with tearless eyes we'll see;
Yes, there, up there, we'll understand.


741
Precious words like music stealing

Precious words like music stealing
O'er the troubled heart opprest;
To the weary, fainting spirit.
Breathing comfort, hope, and rest.

c
Thou ... wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose
mind ... is stayed on Thee, ...
Because ... he trusteth in Thee ... because ...
he trusteth in Thee. ...

Precious words that cheer us onward,
When the day is dark and drear;
Lighting up the path before us,
While their loving tones we hear.

Precious words of holy promise,
From the home of angels bright;
By the Spirit softly whispered
In the silent hours of night.

Precious words that lift us upward,
All our earthly cares above;
To the Fount of life eternal,
And the source of endless love.


742
I see God's sun behind earth's clouds,

I see God's sun behind earth's clouds,
Heaven's blue, beyond earth's grey;
The gleaming of the jasper walls
Across earth's dusty way; [mists,
God's light above the darkening
God's calm amidst the strife;
Bright currents of God's sweetest
In darkest seas of life. [peace

I see my Father's smile of love
Light up earth's dreariest frowns;
Fair stars for heaven-diadems
Shine round earth's thorniest crowns;
Betwixt my heart and aught of harm
That sin or sorrow brings,
I see the Everlasting Arms—
The shadow of His wings.

I see the glory from the cross,
Like morning's crimson ray,
Touch from afar earth's night of sin,
And brightening into day:
I see, like sunshine everywhere,
God's goodness, mercy, grace;
And for the rest, I trust His love
Until I see His face.


743
God holds the key of all unknown,

God holds the key of all unknown,
And I am glad;
If other hands should hold the key,
Or if He trusted it to me,
I might be sad.

What if to-morrow's cares were here
Without its rest!
I'd rather He unlocked the day;
And, as the hours swing open, say,
"My will is best."

The very dimness of my sight
Makes me secure;
For, groping in my misty way,
I feel His hand; I hear Him say,
"My help is sure."

I cannot read His future plans;
But this I know:
I have the smiling of His face,
And all the refuge of His grace,
While here below.

Enough! this covers all my wants,
And so I rest!
For what I cannot, He can see,
And in His care I saved shall be,
For ever blest.


744
Mourner, wheresoe'er thou art,

Mourner, wheresoe'er thou art,
At the cross there's room!
Tell the burden of thy heart;
At the cross there's room!
Tell it in thy Saviour's ear,
Cast away thine every fear,
Only speak, and He will hear;
At the cross there's room!

Haste thee, wanderer, tarry not,
At the cross there's room!
Seek that consecrated spot;
At the cross there's room!
Heavy-laden, sore oppressed,
Love can soothe thy troubled breast;
In the Saviour find thy rest;
At the cross there's room!

Thoughtless sinner, come to-day;
At the cross there's room!
Hark! the Bride and Spirit say,
At the cross there's room!
Now a living fountain see,
Opened there for you and me,
Rich and poor, for bond and free;
At the cross there's room!

Blessed thought! for every one
At the cross there's room!
Love's atoning work is done;
At the cross there's room!
Streams of boundless mercy flow,
Free to all who thither go;
Oh, that all the world might know
At the cross there's room!


745
When upon life's billows you are tempest tossed,

When upon life's billows you are tempest tossed,
When you are discouraged, thinking all is lost,
Count your many blessings, name them one by one,
And it will surprise you what the Lord hath done.

Count . . your blessings, name them one by one;
Count . . your blessings, see what God hath done!
Count . . your blessings, name them one by one!
And it will surprise you what the Lord hath done.

Are you ever burdened with a load of care?
Does the cross seem heavy you are called to bear?
Count your many blessings, every doubt will fly,
And you will keep singing as the days go by.

When you look at others with their lands and gold,
Think that Christ has promised you His wealth untold;
Count your many blessings; wealth can never buy
Your reward in heaven, nor your home on high.

So, amid the conflict, whether great or small,
Do not be disheartened, God is over all;
Count your many blessings, angels will attend,
Help and comfort give you to your journey's end.

Only a little while Of walking

Only a little while
Of walking with weary feet,
Patiently over the thorny way
That leads to the golden street.

Suffer if 'tis God's will,
And work for Him while we may;
FromCalvary's cross to Zion's crown
Is only a little way.

Only a little while!
For toiling a few short days,
And then comes the rest, the quiet rest,
Eternity's endless praise.


747
The cross that He gave may be heavy,

The cross that He gave may be heavy,
But it ne'er outweighs His grace:
The storm that I feared may surround me,
But it ne'er excludes His face.

c
The cross is not greater than His grace,
The storm cannot hide His blessed face
I am satisfied to know
That with Jesus here below,
I can conquer every foe.

The thorns in my path are not sharper
Than composed His crown for me:
The cup that I drink not more bitter
Than He drank in Gethsemane.

The light of His love shineth brighter,
As it falls on paths of woe:
The toil of my work groweth lighter,
As I stoop to raise the low.

His will I have joy in fulfilling,
As I'm walking in His sight:
My all to the blood I am bringing,
It alone can keep me right.


748
Christians, wake, no longer sleep:

Christians, wake, no longer sleep:
Shall we rest while others weep?
Shall we sit with folded hands
When the Lord Himself commands?

c
Go and work! ... this hour begin; ...
Go and seek ... the lost to win; ...
From the dark ... abodes of sin, ...
To the feast, oh, bring them in! ...

Do we love the Saviour's Dame?
Can our faith His promise claim?
Have we pledged to Him our all?
Shall we not obey His call?

Do we trust Him as we ought?
Do we live as He has taught?
Are we His, and His alone?
Let our faith by works be shown.

There's a cross that we must bear
If the crown we hope to wear:
Onward, then, with vigour new:
Time is short, the days are few.


749
Oh, where are the reapers that garner in

Oh, where are the reapers that garner in
The sheaves of the good from the fields of sin?
With sickles of truth must the work be done,
And no one may rest till the" harvest home."

c
Where are the reapers? Oh, who will come
And share in the glory of the" harvest home"?
Oh, who will help us to gamer in
The sheaves of good from the fields of sin?

Go out in the byways and search them all:
The wheat may be there, though the weeds are tall:
Then search in the highway, and pass none by,
But gather from all for the home on high.

The fields are all ripening, and far and wide
The world now is waiting the harvest tide:
But reapers are few, and the work is great,
And much will be lost should the harvest wait.

So come with your sickles, ye sons of men,
And gather together the golden grain:
Toil on till the Lord of the harvest come,
Then share in the joy of the" harvest home."


750
Arise and away, ye reapers

Arise and away, ye reapers;
The fields of the golden corn
Are ripe and fully ready for you;
Go forth in the early morn.

c
Press on, press on, to gather the sheaves,
The work is for you alone;
Then haste away, no time for delay;
Go, gather the harvest home.

The gleaners are there before you,
The garners are open wide;
No time to lose, so hasten away,
All day in the field abide.

Toil on till the day is over,
Too soon will the darkness come;
The sun is sinking now in the west;
Then gather the harvest home.


751
To the work! to the work! We are servants of God,

To the work! to the work! We are servants of God,
Let us follow the path that our Master has trod;
With the balm of His counsel our strength to renew,
Let us do with our might what our hands find to do.

c
Toiling on! ... Toiling on! ...
Toiling on! ... Toiling on! ...
Let us hope, ... Let us watch, ...
And labour till the Master comes.

To the work! to the work! Let the hungry be fed,
To the fountain of Life let the weary be led;
In the cross and its banner our glory shall be,
While we herald the tidings, "Salvation is free."

To the work! to the work! There is labour for all,
For the kingdom of darkness and error shall fall:
And the name of Jehovah exalted shall be [
In the loud swelling chorus, "Salvation is free"

To the work! to the work! in the strength of the Lord,
And a robe and a crown shall our labour reward;
When the home of the faithful our dwelling shall be,
And we shout with the ransomed, "Salvation is free."


752
Hark! 'tis the shepherd's voice I hear,

Hark! 'tis the shepherd's voice I hear,
Out in the desert dark and drear,
Calling the sheep who've gone astray,
Far from the shepherd's fold away.

c
Bring them in, bring them in!
Bring them in from the fields of sin!
Bring them in, bring them in!
Bring the wandering ones to Jesus.

Who'll go and help this Shepherd kind,
Help Him the wandering ones to find?
Who'll bring the lost ones to the fold,
Where they'll be sheltered from the cold?

Out in the desert hear their cry,
Out on the mountain wild and high,
Hark! 'tis the Master speaks to thee:
"Go, find My sheep where'er they be."


753
Ho, reapers in the whitened harvest!

Ho, reapers in the whitened harvest!
Oft feeble, faint, and few;
Come, wait upon the blessed Master,
Our strength He will renew.

c
For" they that wait upon the Lord ... shall
renew their strength: ... they shall mount up
with wings, ... they shall mount up with
wings as eagles: they shall run ... and not be
weary; they shall walk and not faint; ...
They shall run ... and not be weary; they
shall walk and not faint; ... they shall run and
not be weary; shall walk and not faint."

Too oft aweary and discouraged,
We pour a sad complaint;
Believing in a living Saviour,
Why should we ever faint?

Rejoice! for He is with us alway,
Lo, even to the end!
Look up! take courage and go forward—
All needed grace He'll send!


754
In the harvest field there is work to do,

In the harvest field there is work to do,
For the grain is ripe, and the reapers few;
And the Master's voice bids the workers true
Heed the call that He gives to-day.

c
Labour on! . . . labour on! . . .
Keep the bright reward in view;
For the Master has said, He will strength renew:
Labour on till the close of day!

Crowd the garner well with its sheaves all bright,
Let the song be glad, and the heart be light;
Fill the precious hours, ere the shades of night
Take the place of the golden day.

In the gleaner's path may be rich reward,
Though the time seems long, and the labour hard;
For the Master's joy, with His chosen shared,
Drives the gloom from the darkest day.

Lo! the Harvest Home in the realms above
Shall be gained by each who has toiled and strove,
When the Master's voice, in its tones of love,
Calls away to eternal day.


755
Have ye heard the song from the golden land?

Have ye heard the song from the golden land?
Have ye heard the glad new song?
Let us bind our sheaves with a willing hand,
For the time will not be long.

c
The Lord of the harvest will soon appear,
His smile, His voice we shall see and hear!
The Lord of the harvest will soon appear,
And gather the reapers home!

They are looking down from the golden land,
Our beloved are looking down;
They have done their work,
they have borne their cross,
And received their promised crown.

Oh, the song rolls on from the golden land,
And our hearts are strong to-day.
For it nerves our souls with its music sweet,
As we toil in the noontide ray.

Oh, the song rolls on from the golden land,
From its vales of joy and flowers;
And we feel and know by a living faith
That its tones will soon be ours.


756
Behold, the Master now is calling

Behold, the Master now is calling
For reapers brave and true;
The golden harvest fields are waiting,
But labourers are few.

c
Go forth, with patience, love, and kindness;
And, in the Master's name,
The blessed news of free salvation
To all the world proclaim!

Go forth, and rescue those that perish,
Where sin and darkness reign;
Go, lend a helping hand to save them,
And break the tempter's chain.

Go, bid the poor with joy and gladness
The feast of love to share;
And He, the Bread of Life Eternal,
Will make them welcome there.

Go forth, the summer days are waning,
Their light will soon be o'er;
The solemn hour is quickly coming,
When we can work no more.


757
Sowing in the morning, sowing seeds of kindness,

Sowing in the morning, sowing seeds of kindness,
Sowing in the noontide and the dewy eves:
Waiting for the harvest, and the time of reaping,
We shall come rejoicing, bringing in the sheaves!

c
Bringing in the sheaves! bringing in the sheaves!
We shall come rejoicing, bringing in the sheaves!

Sowing in the sunshine, sowing in the shadows,
Fearing neither clouds nor winter's chilling breeze
By and by the harvest, and the labour ended,
We shall come rejoicing, bringing in the sheaves!

Go then ever, weeping, sowing for the Master,
Though the loss sustained our spirit often grieves:
When our weeping's over, He will bid us welcome,
We shall come rejoicing, bringing in the sheaves!


758
Leave not for to-morrow the work of to-day,

Leave not for to-morrow the work of to-day,
For time, like an arrow, is speeding away;
The harvest is ready, look out on the plain;
Go, thrust in the sickle and gather the grain.

c
Go, gath - - er the golden grain;
Go, gath - - er the golden grain;
The harvest is ready, lock out en the plain;
Go, gather the golden grain.

Leave not for to-morrow the work of to-day,
The moments are precious, then why should we stay?
The Master is calling again and again;
Go, thrust in the sickle and gather the grain.

Leave not for to-morrow the work of to-day,
The summer is waning, no longer delay;
The sheaves for the reaping wave
bright o'er the plain;
Go, thrust in the sickle and gather the grain.


759
Sow in the morn thy seed,

Sow in the morn thy seed,
At eve hold not thine hand;
To doubt and fear give thou no heed,
Broadcast it o'er the land.

Thou know'st not which may thrive,
The late or early sown:
Grace keeps the chosen germ alive,
When and wherever strown.

And duly shall appear
In verdure, beauty, strength,
The tender blade, the stalk, the ear,
And the full corn at length.

Thou canst not toil in vain;
Cold, heat, and moist, and dry,
Shall foster and mature the grain
For garners in the sky.

Hence, when the glorious end,
The day of God, is come,
The angel-reapers shall descend,
And heaven cry, Harvest-home!


760
Is thy cruse of comfort failing?

Is thy cruse of comfort failing?
Rise and share it with a friend!
And through all the years of famine
It shall serve thee to the end.
Love divine will fill thy storehouse,
Or thy handful still renew;
Scanty fare for one will often
Make a royal feast for two.

For the heart grows rich in giving:
All its wealth is living grain;
Seeds—which mildew in the garner—
Scattered, fill with gold the plain.
Is thy burden hard and heavy?
Do thy steps drag wearily?
Help to lift thy brother's burden—
God will bear both it and thee.

Lost and weary on the mountains,
Wouldst thou sleep amidst the snow?
Chafe that frozen form beside thee,
And together both shall glow.
Art thou wounded in life's battle?
Many stricken round thee moan;
Give to them thy precious ointment,
And that balm shall heal thine own.

Is thy heart a well left empty?
None but God its void can fill;
Nothing but a ceaseless fountain
Can its ceaseless longings still.
Is thy heart a living power?
Self-entwined, its strength sinks low;
It can only live by loving,
And by serving love will grow.


761
Ho! reapers of life's harvest,

Ho! reapers of life's harvest,
Why stand with rusted blade,
Until the night draws round you,
And day begins to fade?
Why stand ye idle, waiting
For reapers more to come?
The golden morn is passing,
Why sit ye idle, dumb?

Thrust in your sharpened sickle,
And gather in the grain,
The night is fast approaching,
And soon will come again.
The Master calls for reapers,
And shall He call in vain?
Shall sheaves lie there ungathered,
And waste upon the plain?

Come down from hill and mountain,
In morning's ruddy glow,
Nor wait until the dial
Points to the noon below;
And come with the strong sinew,
Nor fainl in heat or cold;
And pause not till the evening
Draws round its wealth of gold.

Mount up the heights of Wisdom,
And crush each error low;
Keep back no words of knowledge
That human hearts should know.
Be faithful to thy mission.
In service of thy Lord;
And then a golden chaplet
Shall be thy just reward.


762
Jesus calls us o'er the tumult

Jesus calls us o'er the tumult
Of our life's wild, restless sea;
Day by day His sweet voice soundeth,
Saying, "Christian, follow Me!"

Jesus calls us from the worship
Of the vain world's golden store;
From each idol that would keep us,
Saying, "Christian, love Me more!"

In our joys and in our sorrows,
Days of toil and hours of ease,
Still He calls, in cares and pleasures,
"Christian, love Me more than these!"

Jesus calls us! by Thy mercies,
Saviour, may we hear Thy call;
Give our hearts to Thy obedience,
Serve and love Thee best of all!


763
Lift up your eyes to the fields that ure whitening;

Lift up your eyes to the fields that ure whitening;
Hark! 'tis the voice of the Master and Lord:
See! on each side there is work for the reaper,
Sheaves that are golden shall be the reward.

c
Are you a reaper? Are you a reaper?
Gathering fruit . . . unto life evermore?
Lift up your eyes, for the harvest is ready;
Hasten, oh hasten to gather your store!

Look on the fields how the harvest is wasting,
Waiting for reapers to garner it in!
He that is faithful receiveth his wages;
Joy everlasting the reaper shall win.

Souls that are ready to enter the kingdom,
Wait for the glad invitation today:
"Go ye and tell, "is the word of the Master—
Servant of Jesus, oh hear, and obey!

Reap for His glory in fields that are nearest,
Look all abroad, for the harvest is white;
O'er the wide earth are the sheaves to be garnered—
Hasten, O reaper, fast cometh the night!


764
Are you sitting idle? Still there's work to do;

Are you sitting idle? Still there's work to do;
In the Master's vineyard there's a place for you:
Be a faithful servant, ever ready stand;
Where the Master calls you—lend a helping hand!

c
Lend a hand, lend a hand, lend a helping hand;
Weary ones are falling, lend a helping hand!
Lend a hand, lend a hand, lend a helping hand!
Jesus still is calling, lend a helping hand!

Is your voice now silent? There are songs to sing;
Come and swell the chorus, make His praises ring!
Till the strains are wafted over sea and land,
Reaching up to heaven—lend a helping hand!

Do your prayers no longer reach the throne of grace,
Asking that some wanderer might his steps retrace?
Earnest prayer may keep him—from the sinking sand,
Yours to-day may save him—lend a helping hand


765
Let us with a gladsome mind

Let us with a gladsome mind
Praise the Lord, for He is kind;
For His mercies shall endure,
Ever faithful, ever sure.

He, with all commanding might,
Filled the new-made world with light:
For His mercies shall endure,
Ever faithful, ever sure.

All things living He doth feed,
His full hand supplies their need:
For His mercies shall endure,
Ever faithful, ever sure.

He His chosen race did bless
In the wasteful wilderness:
For His mercies shall endure,
Ever faithful, ever sure.

He hath with a piteous eye
Looked upon our misery:
For His mercies shall endure,
Ever faithful, ever sure.

Let us, then, with gladsome mind,
Praise the Lord, for He is kind;
For His mercies shall endure,
Ever faithful, ever sure.
Service and Reward

In the early morning, verdant fields adorning,

In the early morning, verdant fields adorning,
While the golden sunlight wakes the dewy leaves;
Haste we now with gladness, banish care and sadness,
Go and help the reapers gather in the sheaves!

c
Gather in the sheaves! Gather in the sheaves!
While the voice of nature sweetest music breathes:
Hear the Master calling, hear the echoes falling,
Go and help the reapers gather in the sheaves!

When the days are brightest, when our hearts are lightest;
When the lovely summer fairest beauty weaves;
In the noontide beaming, in the twilight gleaming,
Go and help the reapers gather in the sheaves!

Should our way be dreary, let us never weary;
Earnest, faithful labour greatest joy receives;
Though we toil in sorrow, soon will dawn the morrow,
When we'll cross the river, bearing home the sheaves.

"Arise and shine! thy light is come!

"Arise and shine! thy light is come!
"The Lord hath made thee free!
The chains of darkness bind no more;
Go forth in liberty!

c
"Arise and shine! thy light is come!"
Arise, arise and shine!
With love's bright adorning shine forth as the morning—
Arise, arise and shine!

"Arise and shine! thy light is come!"
Let sin and sorrow hide;
Go forth and show to all the world
That Light and Life abide!

"Arise and shine! thy light is come!
"Thy God thy glory is;
Show forth the wonders of His love,
And let all praise be His.

"Arise and shine! thy light is come!
"And night shall be no more!
Shine till the glory of the Lord
Is known from shore to shore.

Oh, scatter seeds of loving deeds

Oh, scatter seeds of loving deeds
Along the fertile field;
For grain will grow from what you sow,
And fruitful harvest yield.

c
Then day by day, ... along your way, ...
The seeds of pro mise cast, ...
That ripened grain, ... from hill and plain, ...
Be gathered home ... at last. ...

Though sown in tears through weary years,
The seed will surely live;
Though great the cost, it is not lost,
For God will fruitage give.

The harvest-home of God will come;
And after toil and care,
With joy untold your sheaves of gold
Will all be garnered there.


769
Sowing to the Spirit, sowing day by day,

Sowing to the Spirit, sowing day by day,
Dropping seeds of kindness all along the way;
Sowing to the Spirit, trusting in the Lord,
Sweet will be our labour, blessed our reward.

c
Sowing, till in beau ty fades ... the setting sun; ...
Weary not, nor falter, till the work is done.

Sowing to the Spirit, praying as we go,
From the seed we scatter soon the blade will grow;
Sowing and believing, God will send the rain,
We shall see before us fields of golden grain.

Sowing to the Spirit, though our faith be small,
Sowing in our weakness, though the tears may fall;
Sowing late and early, till our work is o'er,
Then will come the reaping, joy for evermore.


770
Bear the cup of loving service,

Bear the cup of loving service,
Sons and daughters of the King;
Water from the living fountain
To the faint and thirsty bring;
Tendered in His loving spirit,
Blessed will the mission be;
E'en the smallest cup that's offered,
Christ, our gracious Lord, will see.

Bear the cup of loving service
To the weary and the sad;
For the draught held out to others
Makes the giver more than glad:
So 'twill yield a double blessing,
Waking sweetest chords of praise,
While we strive to follow Jesus
In His pleasant, peaceful ways.

Bear the cup of loving service,
Listening for the Master's voice;
Ready always for His errands,
In the blessed work rejoice.
Yes, we know, for He hath told us—
And His word is still the same—
He will bless the cup of water
Humbly offered in His name.


771
"Cast thy bread upon the waters,"

"Cast thy bread upon the waters,"
Ye who have but scant supply;
Angel eyes will watch above it,
You shall find it by-and-by.
He who in His righteous balance
Doth each human action weigh,
Will your sacrifice remember,
Will your loving deeds repay.

"Cast thy bread upon the waters,"
Sad and weary, worn with care;
Often sitting in the shadow—
Have you not a crumb to spare?
Can you not to those around you
Sing some little song of hope,
As you look with longing vision
Through faith's mighty telescope?

"Cast thy bread upon the waters,"
You who have abundant store;
It may float on many a billow,
It may strand on many a shore.
You may think it lost for ever;
But, as sure as God is true,
In this life, or in the other,
It will yet return to you.


772
Throw out the Life-Line across the dark wave,

Throw out the Life-Line across the dark wave,
There is a brother whom someone should save;
Somebody's brother! oh, who then will dare
To throw out the Life-Line, his peril to share?

c
Throw out the Life- Line!
Throw out the Life-Line!
Someone is drifting away!
Throw out the Life-Line!
Throw out the Life-Line!
Someone is sinking to-day.

Throw out the Life-Line with hand quick and strong:
Why do you tarry, my brother, so long?
See—he is sinking; oh, hasten to- day—
And out with the Life-Boat! away then, away!

Throw out the Life-Line to danger fraught men,
Sinking in anguish where you've never been:
Winds of temptation and billows of woe
Will soon hurl them out where the dark waters flow.

Soon will the season of rescue be o'er,
Soon will they drift to eternity's shore,
Haste then, my brother! no time for delay,
But throw out the Life-Line, and save them to-day.


773
Oh, the precious love of Jesus,

Oh, the precious love of Jesus,
How it cheers us on our way!
Lightening every heavy burden,
Brightening every weary day!
How it sweetens every sorrow,
Driving all our fears away!
How it shines out in the darkness,
Making sunshine all the way!

Yes, the precious love of Jesus
Gives us smiles in place of tears!
Gives us courage in our troubles,
Helps us conquer all our fears!
It will make our life worth living,
It will help us when we die,
Bear us safely o'er the river,
To our home beyond the sky.

I must have the love of Jesus
If I do His service here;
I must feel His arm beneath me,
I must know His presence near:
Then He'll bless me in my labour,
Then He'll lead me in the right,
Help me win lost souls for heaven
Out of darkness into light.

Oh, I have the love of Jesus!
Praise His name, I know Him well!
And I love to sing His praises—
Yes, I joy His love to tell!
Come and join me in His praises,
Come and know His love to you,
Come and help me in the singing
Of the song that's ever new!


774
One little hour for watching with the Master,

One little hour for watching with the Master,
Eternal years to walk with Him in white;
One little hour to bravely meet disaster,
Eternal years to reign with Him in light.

c
Then, souls, be brave, and watch until the morrow!
Awake! arise! your lamps of purpose trim;
Your Saviour speaks across the night of sorrow;
Can ye not watch one little hour with Him?

One little hour to suffer scorn and losses,
Eternal years beyond earth's cruel frowns;
One little hour to carry heavy crosses,
Eternal years to wear unfading crowns.

One little hour for weary toils and trials,
Eternal years for calm and peaceful rest;
One little hour for patient self-denials,
Eternal years of life where life is blest.

Oh, list to the voice of the prophet of old,

Oh, list to the voice of the prophet of old,
Proclaiming in language divine,
The wonderful, wonderful message of truth—
That" they that be wise shall shine!"

c
They shall shine as bright as the stars
In the firmament jewelled with light;
And they that turn many to righteousness
As the stars for ever bright.

Though rugged the path where our duty may lead,
Oh, why should we ever repine?
When faithful and true is the promise to all—
That" they that be wise shall shine!"

The grandeur of wealth, and the temples of fame,
Where beauty and splendour combine.
Will perish forgotten, and crumble to dust;
But" they that be wise shall shine!"

Then let us go forth to the work yet to do,
With zeal that shall never decline;
Be strong in the Lord, and the promise believe—
That" they that be wise shall shine!"

Where is my wandering boy to- night—

Where is my wandering boy to- night—
The boy of my tenderest care,
The boy that was once myjoy and light,
The child of my love and prayer?

c
Oh, where is my boy to-night?
Oh, where is my boy to-night?
My heart o'erflow3, for I love him he knows!
Oh, where is my boy to-night?

Once he was pure as morning dew,
As he knelt at his mother's knee;
No face was so bright, no heart more true,
And none was so sweet as he,

Oh, could I see you now, my boy,
As fair as in olden time,
When prattle and smile made home a joy,
And life was a merry chime!

Go for my wandering boy to-night;
Go, search for him where you will;
But bring him to me with all his blight,
And tell him I love him still!


777
Go bury thy sorrow, the world hath its share,

Go bury thy sorrow, the world hath its share,
Go, bury it deeply, go, hide it with care;
Go think of it calmly, when curtained by night;
Go tell it to Jesus, and all will be right,

Go tell it to Jesus, He knoweth thy grief;
Go tell it to Jesus, He'll send thee relief;
Go gather the sunshine He sheds on the way;
He'll lighten thy burden — go, weary one, pray.

Hearts growing a-weary with heavier woe
Now droop 'mid the darkness—go, comfort them, go!
Go bury thy sorrow, let others be blest;
Go give them the sunshine, tell Jesus the rest.


778
Work, for the night is coming,

Work, for the night is coming,
Work through the morning hours;
Work while the dew is sparkling,
Work 'mid springing flowers;
Work when the day grows brighter,
Work in the glowing sun;
Work, for the night is coming,
When man's work is done.

Work, for the night is coming,
Work through the sunny noon;
Fill brightest hours with labour,
Rest comes sure and soon.
Give very flying minute
Something to keep in store;
Work, for the night is coming,
When man works no more.

Work, for the night is coming,
Under the sunset skies;
While their bright tints are glowing,
Work, for daylight flies.
Work till the last beam fadeth,
Fadeth to shine no more;
Work while the night is darkening,
When man's work is o'er.


779
Gather them in! for there yet is room

Gather them in! for there yet is room
At the feast that the King has spread;
Oh, gather them in! —let His house be filled,
And the hungry and poor be fed.

c
Out in the highway, out in the byway,
Out in the dark paths of sin,
Go forth, go forth, with a loving heart,
And gather the wanderers in!

Gather them in! for there yet is room;
But our hearts—how they throb with pain,
To think of the many who slight the
call That may never be heard again!

Gather them in! for there yet is room;
'Tis a message from God above;
Oh, gather them into the fold of grace,
And the arms of the Saviour's love!


780
Would we be joyful in the Lord?

Would we be joyful in the Lord?
Then count the riches o'er
Revealed to faith within His Word,
And note the boundless store.

c
There is par don, peace, and power,
And purity, ... and Paradise;
With all of these ... in Christ for me,
Let joyful songs of praise to Kim arise!

For every sin, by grace divine,
A pardon free bestowed;
And with the pardon peace is mine,
The peace in Jesus' blood.

Of grace to break the power of sin,
He gives a full supply;
The Holy Ghost the heart within
From sin doth purify.

The power to win a soul to God
The Spirit too imparts;
And He, the gift of Christ our Lord,
Dwells now in all our hearts.

These blessings we by faith receive,
By simple childlike trust;
In Christy 'tis God's delight to give:
He promised, and He must.

Here below, on life's rough billows,

Here below, on life's rough billows,
'Neath our Saviour's smile,
Let us fight as Christian soldiers—
'Tis but for awhile.

c
Life's billows cannot harm us.
If our hopes be stayed
On the blessed loving Saviour,
Who our ransom paid!

Soon our fighting shall be ended,
Soon shall warfare cease;
Then, in the celestial city,
We shall reign in peace.

Sweet the Name on which forgiven
Sinners love to dwell!
Go ye to the poor and wretched,
And the good news tell.

Many, on their bed of anguish,
On this world depend:
Go and point them to the Saviour—
He's the sinner's Friend!

Oh, if every guilty sinner
Did the Saviour know,
Then we might exclaim with ghdness,
"Heaven's begun below!"

Let us, while on life's rough billows,
Trust in Him alone;
Then we shall with joy behold Him
On His glorious throne.


782
Who will man the life-boat? who the storm will brave?

Who will man the life-boat? who the storm will brave?
Many souls are drifting helpless on the wave;
See their hands uplifted, hear their bitter cry:
"Save us ere we perish, save us ere we die!"

c
Who will man the life-boat? who will launch away?
Who will help to rescue dying souls to-day?
Who will man the life-boat? who will breast the wave?
All its dangers braving, precious souls to save?

See! amid the breakers yonder vessel tossed!
Onward to the rescue: haste, or all is lost!
Waves that dash around us cannot overwhelm,
While our faithful Pilot standeth at the helm.

Darker yet, and darker grows the fearful night:
Sound the trump of mercy, flash the signal light!
Bear the joyful message o'er the raging wave,
Christ, the heavenly Pilot, comes the lost to save!


783
The walls of Jericho were strong;

The walls of Jericho were strong;
But stronger was the mighty Lord:
And He—the Captain of God's host—
Had given them His faithful word:—
That if they would the walls surround,-
And would the trumpets blow;
He then would give them victory,
And overthrow their foe.

The gates of Jericho were strong—
They could not any stronger be:
But there was One who them defied—
And with the host of God was He.
No work for Him would be too great,
Too hard to undertake;
For He could burst the gates of brass
The bars of iron break.

And we, O Lord, are waging war
Against the mighty hosts of sin:
And neither skill nor strength have we,
So oft have we defeated been.
But if Thou wilt our Captain be,
Our weakened ranks command,
Then led by Thee we'll face the foe.
His fierce assaults withstand.

Strong Son of God! we need more faith
In Thine almighty power to save:
Oh! hear the prayer of contrite hearts
As we Thy keeping grace would crave;
Help us to trust in Thee alone,
To save us every day;
Oh! make us, in the rest of faith,
Triumphant all the way.


784
Who, who will go to bind the broken heart?

Who, who will go to bind the broken heart?
Burdened with grief and heavy in its woe,
Longing to find in life some better part:
Who, who will go to bind the broken heart?

c
Lord, here am I; send me! send me!
To bind the broken heart,
To find the better part:
Lord, here am I; send me! send me!

Who, who will go to wipe away the tear
From eyes long used to sorrow's briny flow?
To comfort those who stand beside hope's bier?
Who, who will go to wipe away the tear?

c
Lord, here am I; send me! send me!
To wipe away the tear,
To stand beside hope's bier:
Lord, here am I; send me! send me I

Who, who will go to seek the lambs astray?
To lift the fallen where he lies so low,
Into the sunlight of the heavenly way:
Who, who will go to seek the lambs astray?

c
Lord, here am I; send me! send me!
To seek the lambs astray,
To point the heavenly way:
Lord, here am I; send me! send me!


785
Dismiss me not Thy service, Lord,

Dismiss me not Thy service, Lord,
But train me for Thy will;
For even I, in fields so broad,
Some duties may fulfil;
And I will ask for no reward,
Except to serve Thee still.

How many serve, how many more
May to the service come:
To tend the vines, the grapes to store,
Thou dost appoint for some:
Thou hast Thy young men at the war.
Thy little ones at home.

All works are good, and each is best
As most it pleases Thee;
Each worker pleases when the rest
He serves in charity;
And neither man nor work unbles.
Wilt Thou permit to be.

Our Master all the work hath done
He asks of us to-day;
Sharing His service, every one
Share too His Sonship may:
Lord, I would serve and be a son;
Dismiss me not, I pray.


786
Lord, speak to me, that I may speak

Lord, speak to me, that I may speak
In living echoes of Thy tone;
As Thou hast sought, so let me seek
Thy erring children lost and lone.

Oh, lead me, Lord, that I may lead
The wandering and the wavering feet!
Oh, feed me, Lord, that I may feed
Thy hungering ones wiih manna sweet!

Oh, strengthen me, that while I stand
Firm on the Rock, and strong in Thee,
I may stretch out a loving hand
To wrestlers with the troubled sea!


787
I am thinking to-day of that beautiful land

I am thinking to-day of that beautiful land
I shall reach when the sun goeth down;
When through wonderful grace by my Saviour I stand,
Will there be any stars in my crown?

c
Will there be any stars, any stars in my crown,
When at evening the sun goeth down? ...
When I wake with the blest in the mansions of rest,
Will there be any stars in my crown? . . .

In the strength of the Lord let me
labour and pray,
Let me watch as a winner of souls,
That bright stars may be mine in the
glorious day [rolls.
When His praise like the sea-billow

Oh, what joy will it be when His face I behold,
Living gems at His feet to lay down;
It would sweeten my bliss in the city of gold,
Should there be any stars in my crown.


788
Are you shining for Jesus, my brother,

Are you shining for Jesus, my brother,
Shining so clear and so bright,
That the souls that are perishing round you
May be guided to Him by your light?

c
Shining for Jesus, are you shining to-day?
Shining for Jesus, shining ail the way;
Shining for Jesus, in this world of care;
Shining for Jesus, shining everywhere.

Are you shining for Jesus, my brother,
Shining in deed and in word?
Is your life by its purity showing
The likeness of Jesus your Lord?

Are you shining for Jesus, my brother,
Shining for truth and for right,
Where bold unbelief and its minions
Are posing as angels of light?

Oh, shine out for Jesus, my brother,
Shine where He needs you the most;
And shine v/here the darkness hangs deepest
O'er the path of the straying and lost.

Shine only and always for Jesus:
Then, when your toiling is o'er,
In mansions of glory eternal,
You shall shine as the stars ever-more.


789
Must I go—and empty-handed?

"Must I go—and empty-handed?
"Thus my dear Redeemer meet?
Not one day of service give Him,
Lay no trophy at His feet?"

c
Must I go—and empty-handed?
Must I meet my Saviour so?
Not one soul with which to greet Him?
Must I empty-handed go?

Not at death I shrink or falter,
For my Saviour saves me now;
But to meet Him empty-handed,
Thought of that now clouds my brow.

Oh, the years of sinning wasted,
Could I but recall them now,
I would give them to my Saviour,
To His wilt I'd gladly bow.

Up, ye saints, arouse, be earnest!
Up and work while yet 'tis day;
Ere the night of death o'ertake you,
Strive for souls while yet you may.


790
Bear the cross for Jesus, bear it every day;

Bear the cross for Jesus, bear it every day;
Though the path be rugged, bear it all the way;
Bear the cross for Jesus, whatsoe'er it be;
Bear it, and remember all His love for thee.

c
Bear the cross, bear the cross, bear it every day;
Bear the cross for Jesus, bear it all the way.

Bear the cross for Jesus, bear it through the strife;
On through storm or sunshine, up the hill of life;
Bear the cross with patience, though you sigh for rest;
Just the one He giveth is for you the best.

Bear the cross for Jesus; would you know the power
Of His grace to keep you, keep you every hour?
Bear the cross for Jesus, never mind its weight;
We shall leave our burden at His palace gate.


791
When Jesus comes to reward His servants,

When Jesus comes to reward His servants,
Whether it be noon or night,
Faithful to Him will He find us watching,
With our lamps all trimmed and bright?

c
Oh, can we say we are ready, brother?—
Ready for the soul's bright home?
Say, will He find you and me still watching,
Waiting, waiting when the Lord shall come?

If at the dawn of the early morning,
He shall call us one by one,
When to the Lord we restore our talents,
Will He answer thee?—" Well done!"

Have we been true to the trust He left us?
Do we seek to do our best?
If in our hearts there is naught condemns us,
We shall have a glorious rest.

Blessed are those whom the Lord finds watching,
In His glory they shall share;
If He shall come at the dawn or midnight,
Will He find us watching there?


792
Who is on the Lord's side? who will serve the King?

Who is on the Lord's side? who will serve the King?
Who will be His helpers, other lives to bring?
Who will leave the world's side? who will face the foe?
Who is on the Lord's side? who for Him will go?

c
Who is on the Lord's side? who will serve the King?

Who will be His helpers, other fives to bring?
By Thy grand redemption, by Thy grace divine,
We are on the Lord's side; Saviour, we are Thine!

Not for weight of glory, not for crown and palm,
Enter we the army, raise the warrior-psalm;
But for love that claimeth lives for whom He died:
He whom Jesus nameth must be on His side!

Jesus, Thou hast bought us, not with gold or gem,
But with Thine own life-blood, for Thy diadem;
With Thy blessing filling all who come to Thee,
Thou hast made us willing, Thou hast made us free.

Fierce may be the conflict, strong may be the foe;
But the King's own army none can overthrow;
Round His standard ranging, victory is secure,
For His truth unchanging makes the triumph sure.


793
Arise, young men, arise!

"Arise, young men, arise!
"Thy Saviour's loving voice
Now bids thee lift thine eyes,
And in His life rejoice;
He raised the sleeping dead,
And made it grand to live;
For thee His blood was shed,
All help His arm will give.

Arise! for death is nigh,
Life's day is all too brief;
Like light its moments fly,
Its gladness and its grief;
Arise, and take thy part
In God's tremendous fight;
To arms! stir up thy heart—
Go forth in heaven's great might!

Arise from dreams of fame,
From sensual slumber rise;
Keep spotless Christ's dear name,
Thy wealth seek in the skies;
The noblest works await
Thine aid with high reward,
And, crowned at glory's gate,
Thou'lt meet thy risen Lord.


794
Speak kindly! for our days are all

Speak kindly! for our days are all
For angry strife;
There is deep meaning, if we only too few
In our brief life.
No nobler mission can be ours, if we knew,
A pang can stay;
Or if, amidst the rush of tears we see,
Wipe one away.

Speak kindly! gracious words God sent, God-given,
Are never lost;
They come all fragrant with the breath of Heaven,
Yet nothing cost,
Kind words are like kind acts—they steal along
Life's hidden springs;
Then, in the darkest storm, some little song
The sad heart sings.

Speak kindly, graciously; for all around
Are pains and smarts;
The very air is full of moans and sound
Of breaking hearts.
Oh, seek to bind them up at once, as did
Thy gracious Lord;
Then surely will His hand bestow on thee
A bright reward.


795
Do you fear the foe will in the conflict win?

Do you fear the foe will in the conflict win?
Is it dark without you, darker still within?
Clear the darkened windows, open wide the door,
Let the blessed sunshine in.

c
Let the blessed sunshine in, ...
Let the blessed sunshine in; ...
Clear the darkened windows, open wide the door.
Let the blessed sunshine in.

Does your faith grow fainter in the cause you love?
Are your prayers unanswered from the throne above?
Clear the darkened windows, open wide the door,
Let the blessed sunshine in.

Would you go rejoicing on the upward way,
Knowing naught of darkness—dwelling in the day?
Clear the darkened windows, open wide the door,
Let the blessed sunshine in.


796
If in the valley where the bright waters flow,

If in the valley where the bright waters flow,
Jesus my Saviour leads me, gladly I'll go;
If by His hand directed o'er ocean's wave;
Gladly I'll bear His message, lost ones to save.

c
Where the Saviour leads me, I will gladly follow;
Where the loving Saviour leads me, I will gladly go.

Out on the barren mountains, dreary and cold,
Seeking the sheep that wander far from the fold;
Storm-clouds may frown above me, fierce winds may blow;
Yet if my Saviour leads me, onward I'll go.

Where'er the Saviour leads me, I'll follow still,
Patient in joy or sorrow, biding His will;
He knows the path of safety, He knows the way,
Home to the many mansions bright, bright as day.


797
Only a little word, softly and kindly

Only a little word, softly and kindly
Breathed in the ear of the sad and opprest;
Oh, how it tenderly steals like a melody
Over life's billows, and lulls them to rest!

c
Only e little word! Only a little word!
Only a little word, whispered in love!

Only a little word, softly and kindly
Dropped in a heart that is blighted and chilled;
Oh, how its gentle strain tunes every chord again,
Waking the echoes that sorrow has stilled!

Only a little word, carefully spoken,
Borne to the lost on the desert that roam,
Breaks like the morning light, chasing the dreary night,
Pointing them upward, and leading them home.

Only a little word, spoken for Jesus,
Telling His pity, compassion, and love;
Out of the path of sin, thousands may gather in,
Joyful to enter His kingdom above.


798
Fading away like the stars of the morning,

Fading away like the stars of the morning,
Losing their light in the glorious sun—
Thus would we pass from the earth and its toiling,
Only remembered by what we have done.

c
Only remembered, only remembered,
Only remembered by what we have done;
Thus would we pass from the earth and its toiling,
Only remembered by what we have done.

Shall we be missed, though by others succeeded,
Reaping the fields we in spring time have sown?
Yes, but the sowers must pass from their labours,
Ever remembered by what they have done.

Only the truth that in life we have spoken,
Only the seed that on earth we have sown;
These shall pass onward when we are forgotten,
Fruits of the harvest and what we have done.

Oh, when the Saviour shall make up His jewels,
When the bright crowns of rejoicing are won,
Then shall His weary and faithful disciples
All be remembered by what they have done.


799
Work, for time is flying,

Work, for time is flying,
Work with hearts sincere;
Work, for souls are dying,
Work, for night is near;
In the Master's vineyard,
Go and work to-day;
Be no useless sluggard
Standing in the way.

In this glorious calling,
Work till day is o'er;
Work till, evening falling,
You can work no more;
Then your labour bringing
To the King of kings,
Borne, with joy and singing,
Home on angels' wings.

There where saints adore Him,
Where the ransomed meet,
Joy they show before Him,
Bowing at His feet;
Hear the Master saying,
From His heavenly throne,
When thy toil rewarding,
"Labourer, well done!"


800
My Father, this I ask of Thee—

My Father, this I ask of Thee—
Knowing that Thou wilt grant the plea:
For this, and only this I prays
Strength for to-day—just for to-day.

c
Strength for each trial and each task,
What more, my Father, should I ask?
Just as I need it, day by day,
Strength for my weakness—this I pray.

I do not ask a lifted load,
Nor for a smooth and thornless road;
Simply for strength enough to bear
Life's daily burdens anywhere,

Strength for the present hour and need
This given, then I'm blest indeed,
For each day, as it comes, will bring
Sufficient strength for anything.

Strength for to-day, that I may make
Some sad souls glad for Jesus' sake;
Then they with me at eve shall say—
Thank God for strength He gave to-day.


801
Have you had a kindness shown?

Have you had a kindness shown?
Pass it on!
'Twas not given for thee alone:
Pass it on!
Let it travel down the years,
Let it wipe another's tears,
Till in heaven the deed appears—
Pass it on!

Did you hear the loving word?
Pass it on!
Like the singing of a bird?
Pass it on!
Let its music live and grow,
Let it cheer another's woe;
You have reaped what others sow—
Pass it on!

Twas the sunshine of a smile—
Pass it on!
Staying but a little while!
Pass it on!
April beam, the little thing,
Still it wakes the flowers of spring,
Makes the silent birds to sing—
Pass it on!

Have you found the heavenly light?
Pass it on!
Souls are groping in the night,
Daylight gone;
Hold thy lighted lamp on high,
Be a star in someone's sky;
He may live who else would die—
Pass it on!

Be not selfish in thy greed—
Pass it on!
Look upon thy brother's need—
Pass it on!
Live for self, you live in vain;
Live for Christ, you live again;
Live for Him, with Him you reign—
Pass it on!


802
There are lonely hearts to cherish,

There are lonely hearts to cherish,
While the days are going by;
There are weary souls who perish,
While the days are going by:
If a smile we can renew,
As our journey we pursue,
Oh, the good we all may do,
While the days are going by!

c
Going by! . . . Going by! . . .
Going by! . . . Going by! . . .
Oh, the good we all may do,
While the days are going by!

There's no time for idle scorning,
While the days are going by;
Let your face be like the morning,
While the days are going by:
Oh, the world is full of sighs,
Full of sad and weeping eyes;
Help your fallen brother rise,
While the days are going by!

All the loving links that bind us,
While the days are going by;
One by one, we leave behind us,
While the days are going by:
But the seeds of good we sow,
Both in shade and shine will grow,
And will keep our hearts aglow,
While the days are going by!


803
Sound the alarm! Let the watchman cry!—

Sound the alarm! Let the watchman cry!—
"Up! for the day of the Lord is nigh;
WTio will escape from the wrath to come?
Who have a place in the soul's bright home?"

c
Sound the alarm, watchman! sound the alarm
For the Lord will come with a conquering arm
And the hosts of sin, as their ranks advance,
Shall wither and fall at His glance.

Sound the alarm! Let the cry go forth,
Swift as the wind, o'er the realms of earth—
"Flee to the Rock where the soul may hide!
Flee to the Rock! in its cleft abide!"

Sound the alarm on the mountain's brow!
Plead with the lost by the wayside now:
Warn them to come and the truth embrace;
Urge them to come and be saved by grace.

Sound the alarm in the youthful ear;
Sound it aloud that the old may hear;
Blow ye the trump while the day-beams last!
Blow ye the trump till the light is past!


804
Trusting in the Lord thy God,

Trusting in the Lord thy God,
Onward go! onward go!
Holding fast His promised word,
Onward go!
Ne'er deny His worthy name,
Though it bring reproach and shame;
Spreading still His wondrous fame,
Onward go!

Has He called thee to the plough?
Night is coming, serve Him now;
Faith and love in service blend;
On His mighty arm depend;
Standing fast until the end,
Onward go!

Has He given thee golden grain?
Sow, and thou shalt reap again;
To thy Master's gate repair,
Watching be and waiting there;
He will hear and answer prayer:
Onward go!

Has He said the end is near?
Serving Him with holy fear,
Christ thy portion, Christ thy stay,
Heavenly bread upon the way;
Leading on to glorious day:
Onward go!

In this little moment then,
In thy ways acknowledge Him;
Let His mind be found in thee;
Let His will thy pleasure be;
Thus in life and liberty,
Onward go!


805
Brightly beams our Father's mercy

Brightly beams our Father's mercy
From His lighthouse evermore;
But to us He gives the keeping
Of the lights along the shore.

c
Let the lower lights be burning!
Send a gleam across the wave!
Some poor fainting, struggling seaman
You may rescue, you may save.

Dark the night of sin has settled;
Loud the angry billows roar;
Eager eyes are watching, longing,
For the lights along the shore.

Trim your feeble lamp, my brother:
Some poor seaman, tempest-tost,
Trying now to make the harbour,
In the darkness may be lost.


806
Some have crossed the swelling flood,

Some have crossed the swelling flood,
Some are now at home with God—
Well beyond the reach of care,
Free from every hurtful snare:
Gone through death to glory bright,
Present with the Lord in light;
But ere perfect joy begin,
More must yet be gathered in!

c
Saved from death's eternal loss
By the power of Jesus' cross:
From their sorrow, shame, and sin,
More must yet be gathered in.

Some of every land and race,
Souls redeemed by Jesus' grace,
Now are in the Shepherd's fold,
Bought with neither gems nor gold;
Saved from endless death and shame,
Saved to grace the Saviour's name;
Other souls are still to win—
More must yet be gathered in.

Some have drifted far from God,
Trampling on the Saviour's blood,
By the worldling's glitter caught,
Selling life and soul for naught:
Fashion's form for every hour,
Christian name without the power;
Dead in trespasses and sin—
Oh, that they were gathered in!

Some are sunk in vice and shame,
Heedless of the Saviour's name;
Some, in superstition's sway,
Hate the light of Gospel-day:
Thou thy testimony give—
They may yet believe and live;
For, from 'mong the ranks of sin,
More must yet be gathered in!


807
Hark! 'tis the watchman's cry,

Hark! 'tis the watchman's cry,
"Wake, brethren, wake!"
Jesus Himself is nigh,
Wake, brethren, wake!
Sleep is for sons of night,
Ye are children of the light,
Yours is the glory bright,
Wake, brethren, wake!

Call to each wakening band,
"Watch, brethren, watch!"
Clear is our Lord's command,
"Watch, brethren, watch!"
Be ye as men that wait,
Ready at their Master's gate,
E'en though He tarry late,
Watch, brethren, watch!

Heed we the Master's call,
"Work, brethren, work!"
There's room enough for all:
Work, brethren, work!
This vineyard of the Lord
Constant labour doth afford;
Yours is a sure reward,
Work, brethren, work!

Hear we the Shepherd's voice,
"Pray, brethren, pray!"
Would ye His heart rejoice?—
Pray, brethren, pray!
Sin calls for ceaseless care,
Weakness needs the Strong One near;
Long as ye tarry here,
Pray, brethren, pray!


808
There is joy in the service of Jesus our Lord,

There is joy in the service of Jesus our Lord,
There is joy in reposing our faith in His word;
There is joy in confiding our all to His care,
There is joy in sweet answers to prayer.

c
There is joy in the service of Jesus our Lord,
There is fulness of joy and eternal reward;
There is joy that abideth, our souls know it well,
There is joy that we never can tell.

There is joy when we slumber, and joy when we wake,
There is joy when we suffer reproach for His sake;
Though our pathway through life may be toilsome and long,
We will brighten the journey with song.

There is joy when He calls us His workers to be,
There is joy in affliction—His hand we can see;
There is joy in temptation, for then we can hide
In His arms, who was tempted and tried.


809
Labourers for Christ, arise,

Labourers for Christ, arise,
And gird you for the toil!
The dew of promise from the skies
Already cheers the soil.

Go where the sick recline,
Where mourning hearts deplore;
And where the sons of sorrow pine,
Dispense your hallowed lore.

Be faith, which looks above,
With prayer, your constant guest;
And wrap the Saviour's changeless love
A mantle round your breast,

So shall you share the wealth
That earth may ne'er despoil;
And the blest Gospel's saving health
Repay your arduous toil.


810
Awake! awake! the Master now is calling us;

Awake! awake! the Master now is calling us;
Arise! arise! and, trusting in His word,
Go forth, go forth! proclaim the year of jubilee,
And take the Work, the blessed Word, of Christ our Lord.

c
On, on, swell the chorus!
On, on, the Morning Star is shining o'er us!
On, on, while before us
Our mighty, mighty Saviour leads the way! ...
Glory, glory, hear the everlasting throng
Shout hosanna! while we boldly march along!
Faithful soldiers here below,
Only Jesus will we know,
Shouting halleluiahs as we onward go

A cry for light from dying ones in heathen lands;
It comes, it comes, across the ocean's foam;
Then haste, oh, haste, to spread the words of truth abroad,
Forgetting not the starving poor at home, dear home.

O Church of God, extend thy kind, maternal arms
To save the lost on mountains dark and cold!
Reach out thy hand with loving smile to rescue them,
And bring them to the shelter of the Saviour's fold.

Look up! look up! the promised day is drawing near,
When all shall hail, shall hail the Saviour King,
When peace and joy shall fold their wings in every clime,
And glorious hallelujahs o'er the earth shall ring.


811
Fear not! God is thy shield,

Fear not! God is thy shield,
And He thy great reward;
His might has won the field:
Thy strength is in the Lord!

c
Fear not! 'tis God's own voice
That speaks to thee this word:
Lift up your head—rejoice
In Jesus Christ thy Lord!

Fear not! for God has heard
The cry of thy distress;
The water of His Word
Thy fainting soul shall bless.

Fear not! be not dismayed!
He evermore will be
With thee to give His aid,
And He will strengthen thee.

Fear not! ye little flock;
Your Saviour soon will come
The glory to unlock,
And bring you to His home!


812
Young men in Christ, arise!

Young men in Christ, arise!
Own Him your Saviour God,
His name adore;
For by His wondrous sacrifice
He paid the great redemption price,
That all might have eternal life,
That come to God through Him.

Young men in Christ the Lord,
Be mighty in His Word,
Its truths declare;
And seek the Holy Spirit's power
By faith and persevering prayer,
That ye may witness anywhere
That sinful men are found.

Young men in Christ the King,
Your grateful tribute bring
Of love and praise;
United in His royal name,
With loyal hearts His words proclaim
Throughout the world to all young men,
"Ye must be born again!"

Young men in Christ the Friend,
On Him all hopes depend
Of true relief;
To every burdened soul you meet,
His gracious, loving words so sweet,
"Come unto Me, "with love repeat,
"And I will give you rest."

Young men in Christ, behold
The world before you lies
Enslaved in sin!
Make haste to swell the mission band,
Prepared to go at His command
To save lost men in every land
At any sacrifice.

Young men in Christ the Son,
In Him we all are one;
For this He prayed.
Then let us join the heavenly throng,
To sound His praise in endless song,
For all we have and are belong
To Christ, our Lord Divine.

Hark the voice of Jesus crying—

Hark the voice of Jesus crying—
"Who will go and work to-day?
Fields are white, and harvest waiting:
Who will bear the sheaves away?
"Loud and strong the Master calleth,
Rich reward He offers thee:
Who will answer, gladly saying?—
"Here am I; send me, send me!"

If you cannot cross the ocean,
And the heathen lands explore,
You can find the heathen nearer,
You can help them at your door.
If you cannot give your thousands,
You can give the widow's mite;
And the least you do for Jesus
Will be precious in His sight.

If you cannot speak like angels,
If you cannot preach like Paul,
You can tell the love of Jesus,
You can say He died for all.
If you cannot rouse the wicked
With the Judgment's dread alarms,
You can lead the little children
To the Saviour's waiting arms.

If you cannot be the watchman,
Standing high on Zion's wall,
Pointing out the path to heaven,
Offering life and peace to all;
With your prayers and with your bounties
You can do what Heaven demands;
You can be like faithful Aaron,
Holding up the prophet's hands.

If among the older people
You may not be apt to teach:
"Feed My lambs, "said Christ our Shepherd,
"Place the food within their reach."
And it may be that the children
You have led with trembling hand
Will be found among your jewels,
When you reach the better land.

Let none hear you idly saying,
"There is nothing I can do,"
While the souls of men are dying,
And the Master calls for you.
Take the task He gives you gladly,
Let His work your pleasure be;
Answer quickly when He calleth:
"Here am I; send me, send me I"


814
Rescue the perishing, care for the dying,

Rescue the perishing, care for the dying,
Snatch them in pity from sin and the grave:
Weep o'er the erring one, lift up the fallen,
Tell them of Jesus, the Mighty to save.
Rescue the perishing, care for the dying;
Jesus is merciful, Jesus will save.

Though they are slighting Him, still He is waiting.
Waiting the penitent child to receive.
Plead with them earnestly, plead with them gently;
He will forgive if they only believe.

Down in the human heart, crushed by the tempter,
Feelings lie buried that grace can restore:
Touched by a loving hand, wakened by kindness,
Chords that were broken will vibrate once more.

Rescue the perishing, duty demands it;
Strength for thy labour the Lord will provide:
Back to the narrow way patiently win them;
Tell the poor wanderer a Saviour has died.


815
Go, labour on; spend and be spent—

Go, labour on; spend and be spent—
Thy joy to do the Father's will:
It is the way the Master went;
Should not the servant tread it still?

Go, labour on; 'tis not for naught;
Thine earthly loss is heavenly gain:
Men heed thee, love thee, praise thee not;
The Master praises—what are men?

Go, labour on; enough while here,
If He shall praise thee—if He deign
Thy willing heart to mark and cheer:
No toil for Him shall be in vain.

Toil on, and in thy toil rejoice!
For toil—comes rest, for exile—home;
Soon shait thou hear the Bridegroom's voice,
The midnight peal:" Behold, I come!"


816
Speak gently, speak gently, oh grieve not again

Speak gently, speak gently, oh grieve not again
The hearts that are breaking with sorrow and pain;
We know not how bitter the trials they share,
We know not how heavy the burdens they bear.

c
Tenderly, tenderly, lovingly speak!
Tell them of Jesus, the lowly and meek;
Patiently waiting, He longs to receive
All who are willing on Him to believe.

Speak gently, speak gently, oh pity and pray
For those who in darkness have wandered away;
A word kindly spoken the captives may free;
A word may reclaim them—oh speak it, and see!

Speak gently, speak gently, wherever you go,
In tempest, in sunshine, in sorrow or woe;
Speak gently, reposing your trust in the Lord,
And joy without measure will be your reward.


817
Seeking the lost, yes, kindly entreating

Seeking the lost, yes, kindly entreating
Wanderers on the mountain astray;
"Come unto Me, "His message repeating,
Words of the Master speaking to-day.


... Going afar ... upon the mountain, ...
Bringing the wanderer back again, back again ...
Into the fold ... of our Redeemer, ...
Jesus, the Lamb for sinners slain.

Seeking the lost, and pointing to Jesus,
Souls that are weak and hearts that are sore,
Leading them forth in ways of salvation,
Showing the path to life evermore.

Thus would we go on missions of mercy,
Following Christ from day to day;
Cheering the faint, and raising the fallen,
Pointing the lost to Jesus the Way.


818
Not now, my child! —a little more

Not now, my child! —a little more rough tossing,
A little longer on the billows' foam;
A few more journeyings in the desert darkness,
And then the sunshine of thy Father's Home!

Not now; for I have wanderers in the distance,
And thou must call them in with patient love:
Not; now; for I have sheep upon the mountains,
And thou must follow them where'er they rove.

Not now; for I have loved ones sad and weary;
Wilt thou not cheer them with a kindly smile?
Sick ones, who need thee in their lonely sorrow;
Wilt thou not tend them yet a little while?

Not now; for wounded hearts are sorely bleeding,
And thou must teach those widowed hearts to sing;
Not now; for orphans' tears are quickly falling—
They must be gathered 'neath some sheltering wing.

Go, with the name of Jesus to the dying,
And speak that name in all its living power;
Why should thy fainting heart grow chill and weary?
Canst thou not watch with Me one little hour?

One little hour! and then the glorious crowning,
The golden harp-strings, and the victor's palm;
One little hour! and then the hallelujah!
Eternity's long, deep, thanksgiving psalm!


819
There's a city that looks o'er

There's a city that looks o'er the valley of death,
And its glories may never be told;
There the sun never sets, and the leaves never fade,
In that beautiful City of Gold.

c
There the sun never sets, and the leaves never fade;
There the eyes of the faithful their Saviour behold,
In that beautiful City of Gold.

There the King, our Redeemer, the Lord whom we love,
All the faithful with rapture behold;
There the righteous for ever will shine like the stars,
In that beautiful City of Gold.

Every soul we have led to the foot of the cross,
Every lamb we have brought to the fold,
Will be kept as bright jewels our crown to adorn,
In that beautiful City of Gold.


820
Rescue the souls that perish,

Rescue the souls that perish,
Seek for the lost that stray;
atiently guide their footsteps
Into the narrow way;
Over them kindly bending,
Whisper the Saviour's call;
Tell them the feast is ready—
Tell them there's room for all.

c
Room . . for all, . .
Room . . for all; . .
Tell them the feast is ready—
Tell them there's room for all.

Out of the vale of sorrow,
Out of the starless night,
Into the golden sunshine,
Peaceful, and pure, and bright:
Gather them now to Jesus—
Whisper again the call;
Tell them the feast is ready—
Tell them there's room for all.

Go with a loving spirit,
Go in the Master's name:
Life, and a full salvation,
Now to the world proclaim:
Haste while the day-beams linger;
Haste ere the shadows fall;
Tell them the feast is ready—
Tell them there's room for all.


821
Sing on, ye joyful pilgrims,

Sing on, ye joyful pilgrims,
Nor think the moments long;
My faith is heavenward rising
With every tuneful song!
Lo! on the mount of blessing,
The glorious mount, I stand,
And, looking over Jordan,
I see the promised land!

c
Sing on: oh, blissful music!
With every note you raise
My heart is filled with rapture,
My soul is lost in praise!
Sing on: oh, blissful music!
With every note you raise
My heart is filled with rapture,
My soul is lost in praise!

Sing on, ye joyful pilgrims!
While here on earth we stay,
Let songs of home and Jesus
Beguile each fleeting day;
Sing on the grand old story
Of His redeeming love—
The everlasting chorus
That fills the realms above.

Sing on, ye joyful pilgrims!
The time will not be long,
Till in our Father's kingdom
We sing a nobler song!
Where those we love are waiting
To greet us on the shore,
We'll meet beyond the river,
Where surges roll no more.


822
With joy I draw from out God's well

With joy I draw from out God's well
Rich blessings day by day,
While living waters springing up
I find beside the way.
The blessed flow of this deep well
Makes fruitful life abound,
A watered garden in the soul
Where'er this well is found.

As on I go with willing hands
And earnest heart to do,
Oft weary, 'neath the burden's weight,
Where labourers are but few—
I pause to gather strength beside
The well that springeth up,
And from its fulness, rich and pure,
I fill my empty cup.

Still on, amid a desert path
Where every spring is dry,
There, all alone,—my loved ones gone,—
To heaven I lift my cry:
When lo, upon my fainting sight,
As onward still I go,
Fair Elim breaks with waving palms
And wells of crystal flow.

And then, as on my pathway leads
Through shadows, toil, and strife,
I reach a lowly, quiet vale—
A sheltered spot in life:

Within its shade, where jarring notes
Of earthly discord cease,
I gather hearts-ease day by day
At God's sweet well of peace.


823
Come, ye that love the Lord,

Come, ye that love the Lord,
And let your joys be known,
Join in a song with sweet accord,
Join in a song with sweet accord,
And thus surround the throne,
And thus surround the throne.

c
We're marching to Zion,
Beautiful, beautiful Zion;
We're marching upward to Zion,
The beautiful city of God.

Let those refuse to sing
Who never knew our God;
But children of the heavenly King,
Must speak their joys abroad.

The hill of Zion yields
A thousand sacred sweets,
Before we reach the heavenly fields,
Or walk the golden streets.

Then let our songs abound,
And every tear be dry;
We're marching through Immanuel's ground,
To fairer worlds on high.


824
Along the sandy desert,

Along the sandy desert,
'Mid scorching winds that blow;
Across the rugged mountains,
Whose tops are white with snow;
Or in the darksome valley—
Where'er our feet may roam,
How sweet the blest assurance,
That Jesus leads us home!

c
That Jesus leads us home, . .
That Jesus leads us home, . .
How sweet the blest assurance,
That Jesus leads us home!

It makes us glad and joyful,
And lightens every load,
To know that He goes with us
Along life's rugged road;
Each day we feel His presence,
Though trials oft may come:
How sweet the blest assurance,
That Jesus leads us home!

The flowers beside our pathway
May wither, fade, and die;
But fairer ones are blooming
For us beyond the sky:
And though 'mid care and sorrow
Our weary steps may roam,
How sweet the blest assurance,
That Jesus leads us home!


825
There are shadows in the valley,

There are shadows in the valley,
Where our tired feet must go:
But we hear the peaceful waters,
As they murmur soft and low—
And our Shepherd whispers gently,
As He leads us onward still:
"There are shadows in the valley,
But 'tis sunshine on the hill."

c
Sunshine on the hill,
There is sunshine on the hill; ...
"There are shadows in the valley,
But 'tis sunshine on the hill."

There are shadows in the valley,
But we breathe the sweet perfume
Of the roses on the mountain,
In their lovely vernal bloom;
And again our Shepherd whispers,
As He leads us onward still:
"There are shadows in the valley,
But 'tis sunshine on the hill."

Oh, the shadows in the valley,
Like a dream will pass away:
They will vanish at the dawning
Of the bright and glorious day!
Even now there comes an echo,
And we feel its magic thrill:
"There are shadows in the valley,
But 'tis sunshine on the hill."


826
I'm a pilgrim and a stranger,

I'm a pilgrim and a stranger,
Rough and thorny is the road;
Often in the midst of danger;
But it leads to God.
Clouds and darkness oft distress me,
Great and many are my foes;
Anxious cares and thoughts oppress me:
But my Father knows.

Oh, how sweet is this assurance,
'Mid the conflict and the strife!
Although sorrows past endurance
Follow me through life.
Home in prospect still can cheer me,
Yes, and give me sweet repose,
While I feel His presence near me:
For my Father knows.

Yes, He sees and knows me daily,
Watches over me in love;
Sends me help when foes assail me—
Bids me look above.
Soon my journey will be ended,
Life is drawing to a close;
I shall then be well attended:
This my Father knows.

I shall then with joy behold Him—
Face to face my Father see;
Fall with rapture and adore Him,
For His love to me.
Nothing more shall then distress me,
In the land of sweet repose;
Jesus stands engaged to bless me:
This my Father knows.


827
I'm a pilgrim, and I'm a stranger,

I'm a pilgrim, and I'm a stranger,
I can tarry, I can tarry but a night;
Do not detain me, for I am going
To where the streamlets are ever flowing.

c
I'm pilgrim, ... and I'm a stranger; ...
I can tarry, I can tarry but a night: ...
I'm a pilgrim, ... and I'm a stranger; ...
I can tarry, I can tarry but a night. ...

Of that city, to which I journey,
My Redeemer, my Redeemer is the light;
There is no sorrow, nor any sighing,
Nor any tears there, nor any dying.

There the sunbeams are ever shining;
Oh, my longing heart, my longing heart is there;
Here in this country, so dark and dreary,
I long have wandered forlorn and weary.


828
Travelling to the better land,

Travelling to the better land,
G*er the desert's scorching sand,
Father, do Thou hold my hand,
And lead me, lead me on.

When at Marah, parched with heat,
I the sparkling fountain greet,
Make the bitter waters sweet,
And lead me, lead me on.

When the wilderness is drear,
Show me Elim's palm-groves near,
With its wells, as crystal clear,
And lead me, lead me on.

Through the water and the fire,
This, O Lord, my one desire:
With Thy love my heart inspire,
And lead me, lead me on.

When I stand on Jordan's brink,
Do not let me fear or shrink;
Hold me, Father, lest I sink,
And lead me, lead me on.


829
Oppressed by noonday's scorching heat,

Oppressed by noonday's scorching heat,
To yonder Cross I flee,
Beneath its shelter take my seat-
No shade like this to me!

Beneath that Cross clear waters burst.
A fountain sparkling free,
And there I quench my desert thirst—
No spring like this to me!

For burdened ones a resting-place
Beside that Cross I see;
Here I cast off my weariness—
No rest like this for me!

A stranger here I pitch my tent
Beneath this spreading tree;
Here shall my pilgrim life be spent-
No home like this for me!


830
Light after darkness, gain after loss,

Light after darkness, gain after loss,
Strength after weakness, crown after cross;
Sweet after bitter, hope after fears,
Home after wandering, praise after tears.

Sheaves after sowing, sun after rain,
Sight after mystery, peace after pain;
Joy after sorrow, calm after blast,
Rest after weariness, sweet rest at last.

Near after distant, gleam after gloom,
Love after loneliness, life after tomb;
After long agony, rapture of bliss,
Right was the pathway leading to this.


831
Leader of faithful souls, and Guide

Leader of faithful souls, and Guide
Of all that travel to the sky,
Come, and with us, e'en us abide,
Who would on Thee alone rely;
On Thee alone our spirits stay,
While held in life's uneven way.

Strangers and pilgrims here below,
This earth, we know, is not our place;
But hasten through the vale of woe,
And, restless to behold Thy face,
Swift to our heavenly country move,
Our everlasting home above,

Through Thee, who all our sins hast borne,
Freely and graciously forgiven,
With songs to Zion we return,
Contending for our native heaven;
That palace of our glorious King,
We find it nearer while we sing.

Raised by the breath of love divine,
We urge our way with strength renewed,
The church of the first-born to join,
We travel to the mount of God;
With joy upon oar heads arise,
And meet our Captain in the skies.


832
Let us sing a song that will cheer us by the way—

Let us sing a song that will cheer us by the way—
In a little while we're going home;
For the night will end in the everlasting day—
In a little while we're going home.

c
In a little while, . . In a little while . .
We shall cross the billow's foam:
We shall meet at last When the stormy winds are past—
In a little while we're going home.

We will do the work that our hands may find to do—
In a little while we're going home;
And the grace of God will our daily strength renew—
In a little while we're going home.

We will smooth the path for some weary, way-worn feet—
In a little while we're going home;
Oh, may loving hearts spread around an influence sweet!
In a little while we're going home.

There's a rest beyond, there's relief from every care—
In a little while we're going home;
And no tears shall fall in that city bright and fair—
In a little while we're going home.


833
We are pilgrims looking home,

We are pilgrims looking home,
Sad and weary oft we roam;
But we know 'twill all be well in the morning,
When, our anchor firmly cast,
Every stormy wave is past,
And we gather safe at last in the morning.

c
When we all meet again in the morning,
On the sweet blooming hills in the morning:
Nevermore to say" good-night"
In that sunny region bright,
When we hail the blessed light of the morning.

Oh, these tender broken ties,
How they dim our aching eyes;
But like jewels they will shine in the morning,
When our victor palms we bear,
And our robes immortal wear,
We shall know each other there, in the morning.

When our fettered souls are free,
Far beyond the narrow sea,
And we hear the Saviour's voice in the morning;
When our golden sheaves we bring
To the feet of Christ our King,
What a chorus we shall sing in the morning.

On the pilgrim journey here,
Though the night is sometimes drear,
Let us watch and persevere, till the morning;
Then our highest tribute raise
For the love that crowns our days,
And to Jesus give the praise in the morning.


834
Press on, press on, O pilgrim,

Press on, press on, O pilgrim,
Rejoicing in the Lord;
Believing in His promise,
And trusting in His word;
Fear not! for He is with us,
Whate'er the cross we bear;
And soon, beyond the swelling tide,
We'll gather over there!

c
Gather over there! gather over there!
And soon, beyond the swelling tide,
we'll gather over there!

Press on, press on, O pilgrim,
Along the heavenly way;
Remember, God commands us
To watch, and work, and pray;
He bids us all be faithful,
And cast on Him our care;
And soon, beyond the swelling tide,
We'll gather over there!

Press on, press on, O pilgrim,
Though clouds and storms may rise;
The Light that never faileth
Shines brightly in the skies:
Press on where crowns await us,
In yonder mansions fair;
And soon, beyond the swelling tide,
We'll gather over there!


835
Spring up, O well of blessing,

Spring up, O well of blessing,
Spring in our midst to-day;
For thirsty souls are longing
To drink abundantly:
Come from the hidden fountains,
Come in a brimming flood;
Refresh us in the desert,
Thou precious gift of God.

c
We sing the song that Israel
sang in the desert long ago:
"Spring up, O well, spring up, O well;
"let the living waters flow.

Spring up, O well of blessing,
We cry to Thee to-day;
Break forth in mighty torrent,
As now we sing and pray:
The souls that round us perish—
The old, the young, the strong;
To Thee, by right and ransom,
The Lord of Hosts belong.

Spring up, O well of blessing,
We sing to Thee to-day;
The" princes" and the" nobles"
Thy great command obey:
In toiling and in labour,
Amid the burning sand,
Spring up, flow forth, and gladden
The whole expectant land.


836
Simply trusting every day,

Simply trusting every day,
Trusting through a stormy way;
Even when my faith is small,
Trusting Jesus, that is all.

c
Trusting as the moments fly,
Trusting as the days go by;
Trusting Him whate'er befal,
Trusting Jesus, that is all.

Brightly doth His Spirit shine
Into this poor heart of mine;
While He leads I cannot fall,
Trusting Jesus, that is all.

Singing, if my way be clear;
Praying, if the path be drear;
If in danger, for Him call;
Trusting Jesus, that is all.

Trusting Him while life shall last,
Trusting Him till earth be past,
Till within the jasper wall:
Trusting Jesus, that is all.


837
Forward! be our watchword,

Forward! be our watchword,
Steps and voices joined;
Seek the things before us,
Not a look behind:
Burns the fiery pillar
At our army's head;
Who shall dream of shrinking,
By our Captain led?
 Forward through the desert,
 Through the toil and fight;
 Canaan lies before us,
 Zion beams with light.

Forward! flock of Jesus,
Salt of all the earth:
Till each yearning purpose
Spring to glorious birth;
Sick, they ask for healing,
Blind, they grope for day;
Pour upon the nations
Wisdom's loving ray!
 Forward, out of error,
 Leave behind the night;
 Forward through the darkness,
 Forward into light.

Glories upon glories
Hath our God prepared,
By the souls that love Him
One day to be shared:
Eye hath not beheld them;
Ear hath never heard;
Nor of these hath uttered
Thought or speech a word;
 Forward, ever forward,
 Clad in armour bright;
 Till the vail be lifted,
 Till our faith be sight.

Far o'er yon horizon
Rise the city towers,
Where our God abideth;
That fair home is ours!
Flash the streets with jasper,
Shine the gates with gold;
Flows the gladdening river,
Shedding joys untold:
 Thither, onward, thither,
 In the Spirit's might:
 Pilgrims, to your country,
 Forward into light!


838
Children of the heavenly King,

Children of the heavenly King,
As we journey let us sing;
Sing our Saviour's worthy praise,
Glorious in His works and ways.

c
We are trav 'lling home to God, .
In the way . . . our fathers trod, . . .
They are hap py now, and we . ...
Soon their happiness shall see.

Lift your eyes, ye sons of light—
Zion's city is in sight;
There our endless home shall be,
There our Lord we soon shall see.

Fear not, brethren! joyful stand
On the borders of our land!
Jesus Christ, our Father's Son,
Bids us undismayed go on.

Lord, obediently we'll go,
Gladly leaving all below;
Only Thou our Leader be,
And we still will follow Thee.


839
Only to know that the path I tread

Only to know that the path I tread
Is the path marked out for me;
That the way, though thorny, rough, and steep,
Will lead me nearer to Thee!
Nearer to Thee! nearer to Thee!
Blessed Redeemer, to Thee!
Only to know that the path I tread
Is bringing me nearer to Thee!

Only to know when the day is past,
And the evening shadows come,
That its trials and cares have proved indeed
A" day's march nearer home"!
Nearer my home! nearer my home!
Nearer my beautiful home!
Only to know that each fast-fleeting day
Is bringing me nearer home!

Only to know that the cross I see
Is the cross of Calvary,
On which the world's Redeemer died,
To purchase life for me!
Purchased for me! purchased for me!
Life Thou hast purchased for me!
Only to know that Thy death on the cross
Brings light and life to me!

Only to know His peace within,
My will to His resigned;
Oh, fill me with Thy fulness, Lord,
And make me wholly Thine!
Wholly Thine! wholly Thine!
Now and for ever Thine!
Fill me with love and peace divine,
And make me wholly Thine!


840
'Twill not be long—our journey here;

'Twill not be long—our journey here;
Each broken sigh and falling tear
Will soon be gone; and all will be
A cloudless sky, a waveless sea.

c
Roll on, . . dark stream I . .
We dread not thy foam;
The pilgrim is longing for home, sweet home.

'Twill not be long! the yearning heart
May feel its every hope depart,
And grief be mingled with its song;
We'll meet again, 'twill not be long!

Though sad we mark the closing eye
Of those we loved in days gone by,
Yet sweet in death their latest song:
"We'll meet again, 'twill not be long!"

These chequered wilds, with thorns
o'erspread,
Through which our way so oft is led—
This march of time, if faith be strong,
Will end in bliss; 'twill not be long!


841
'Tis the promise of God full salvation to give

'Tis the promise of God full salvation to give
Unto him who on Jesus, His Son,will believe.

c
Hallelujah! 'tis done; I believe on the Son;
I am saved by the blood of the Crucified One!

Though the pathway be lonely and dangerous too,
Surely Jesus is able to carry me through.

Many loved ones have I in yon heavenly throng—
They are safe now in glory, and this is their song:

Little children I see standing close by their King,
And He smiles, as their song of salvation they sing:

There are prophets and kings in that throng I behold,
And they sing as they march through
the streets of pure gold:

There's a part in that chorus for you and for me,
And the theme of our praises for ever will be:


842
We walk by faith, . . . and oh, how sweet . . .

We walk by faith, . . . and oh, how sweet . . .
The flowers that grow . . . beneath our feet, . . .
And fragrance breathe . . . along the way . . .
That leads the soul ... to endless day. . . .

c
We walk by faith, but not alone,
Our Shepherd's tender voice we hear,
And feel His hand within our own,
And know that He is always near.

We walk by faith, ... He wills it so, ...
And marks the path ... that we should go; ...
And when at times ... our sky is dim, ...
He gently draws ... us close to Him. . . .

We walk by faith, ... divinely blest, ...
On Him we lean, ... in Him we rest; ...
The more we trust ... our Shepherd's care, ...
The more His love ... 'tis ours to share. ...

And thus by faith, ... till life shall end, ...
We'll walk with Him, ... our dearest Friend, ...
Till safe we tread ... the fields of light, ...
Where faith is lost ... in perfect sight. ...


843
Oh, shall I be among that throng,

Oh, shall I be among that throng,
All clothed in robes of white,
And help to swell that glorious song
Of rapture and delight?

c
I shall! for I have been redeemed
With blood of worth untold—
The blood of Christ, the Lamb of God,
More precious far than gold!

Oh, shall I see my Saviour's face,
All radiant as the sun,
And dwell through all eternity
With God's Beloved One?

Shall I in glory Christ behold
Exalted King and Lord?
What rapture, yea, what bliss untold,
That moment will afford!

Oh, shall I gaze upon the wounds,
From whence hath flowed the blood
That cleansed my guilty, sinful heart,
And brought me nigh to God?

Oh, shall I ever, "with the Lord,"
As I retrace the past,
Praise Him for all His wondrous grace
To me from first to last?


844
I could not do without Thee,

I could not do without Thee,
I could not do without Thee,
Saviour of the lost,
Whose precious blood redeemed me
At such tremendous cost:
Thy righteousness, Thy pardon,
Thy Sacrifice, must be
My only hope and comfort,
My glory and my plea.

I could not do without Thee,
I cannot stand alone,
I have no strength or goodness,
No wisdom of my own:
But Thou, beloved Saviour,
Art all in all to me;
And weakness will be power,
If leaning hard on Thee.

I could not do without Thee,
For years are fleeting fast,
And soon in solemn silence
The river must be passed:
But Thou wilt never leave me;
And, though the waves run high,
I know Thou wilt be near me,
And whisper, "It is I."


845
Whom have I, Lord, in heaven but Thee?

Whom have I, Lord, in heaven but Thee?
None but Thee! None but Thee!
And this my song thro' life shall be:
Christ for me! Christ for me!
He hath for me the winepress trod,
He hath redeemed me" by His blood,"
And reconciled my soul to God:
Christ for me! Christ for me!

I envy not the rich their joys:
Christ for me! Christ for me!
I covet not earth's glittering toys:
Christ for me! Christ for me!
Earth can no lasting bliss bestow,
"Fading" is stamped on all below;
Mine is a joy no end can know:
Christ for me! Christ for me!

Though with the poor be cast my lot:
Christ for me! Christ for me!
"He knoweth best,"—I murmur not:
Christ for me! Christ for me!
Though"vine" and"fig tree" blight assail,
The" labour of the olive fail,"
And death o'er flock and herd prevail,
Christ for me! Christ for me!

Though I am now on hostile ground,
Christ for me! Christ for me!
And sin beset me all around,
Christ for me! Christ for me!
Let earth her fiercest battles wage
And foes against my soul engage,
Strong in His strength I scorn their rage:
Christ for me! Christ for me!

5 And when my life draws to its close,
Christ for me! Christ for me!
Safe in His arms I shall repose,
Christ for me! Christ for me!
When sharpest pains my frame pervade,
And all the powers of nature fade,
Still will I sing through death's cold shade,
Christ for me! Christ for me!


846
A long time I wandered in darkness and sin,

A long time I wandered in darkness and sin,
And wondered if ever the light would shine in;
I heard Christian friends speak of raptures divine,
And I wished—how I wished—that their Saviour were mine.

c
I wished He were mine, yes, I wished He were mine;
I wished—how I wished—that their Saviour were mine.

I heard the glad gospel of" good-will to men";
I read" whosoever" again and again;
I said to my soul, "Can that promise be thine?"
And then began hoping that Jesus was mine.
I hoped He was mine, yes, I hoped He was mine;
And then began hoping that Jesus was mine.

Oh, mercy surprising! He saves even me!
"Thy portion for ever, "He says,"will I be;"
On His word I am resting—assurance divine:
I am" hoping" no longer; I know He is mine.
I know He is mine, yes, I know He is mine!
I'm hoping no longer, I know He is mine.


847
'Twas Jesus, my Saviour, who died on the tree,

'Twas Jesus, my Saviour, who died on the tree,
To open a fountain for sinners like me;
His blood is that fountain which pardon bestows,
And cleanses the foulest wherever it flows.
For the Lion of Judah shall break every chain,
And give us the victory again and again.

And when I was willing with all things to part,
He gave me His blessing, His love in my heart;
So now I am joined with the conquering band
Who are marching to glory at Jesus' command.

Though round me the storms of adversity roll,
And the waves of destruction encompass my soul,
In vain this frail vessel the tempest shall toss—
My hope is secure through the blood of the cross.

And when with the ransomed, by Jesus, my Head,
From fountain to fountain I then shall be led;
I'll fall at His feet and His mercy adore,
And sing Hallelujah to God evermore.


848
'Tis the grandest theme through the ages rung,

'Tis the grandest theme through the ages rung,
'Tis the grandest theme for a mortal tongue,
'Tis the grandest theme that the world e'er sung,"
Our God is able to deliver thee!

c
"He is a - - - ble to deliver thee,
He is a ble to deliver thee;
Though by sin opprest, go to Him for rest:
"Our God is able to deliver thee!"

'Tis the grandest theme heard on earth or main,
'Tis the grandest theme for a mortal strain,
'Tis the grandest theme, tell it out again,
"Our God is able to deliver thee!"

'Tis the grandest theme, let the tidings roll
To the guilty heart, to the weary soul;
Look to God in faith, He will make thee whole:
"Our God is able to deliver thee!"


849
I am not skilled to understand

I am not skilled to understand
What God hath willed, what God hath planned;
I only know at His right hand
Is One who is my Saviour!

I take Him at His word indeed:
"Christ died for sinners"—this I read;
For in my heart I find a need
Of Him to be my Saviour!

That He should leave His place on high,
And come for sinful man to die,
You count it strange?—so once did I,
Before I knew my Saviour!

And oh, that He fulfilled may see
The travail of His soul in me,
And with His work contented be,
As I with my dear Saviour!

Yea, living, dying, let me bring
My strength, my solace from this spring—
That lie who lives to be my King
Once died to be my Saviour!


850
I came a wanderer, and alone,

I came a wanderer, and alone,
My way was dark as night;
I looked to Thee, O blessed One,
And then I found the light.

c
O Jesus, Saviour, Lamb of God,
How much I owe to Thee,
For all the wonders of Thy grace*
And all Thy love to me!

I came with all my doubts and fears,
No hope but in Thy Word;
And while I gazed upon the blood,
Thy pardoning voice I heard.

Oh, may the Spirit's power be felt
In this poor heart of mine,
And make Thy Word my lamp and light,
My shield and strength divine.

Oh, teach me, Lord, Thy voice to know,
Amid the surging throng;
Be Thou my hope, my life, my joy,
My everlasting song.


851
We have a firm foundation,

We have a firm foundation,
Whose hope is in the Lord;
We have a blessed haven,
Who anchor in His word:
Though surges break around us,
And clouds our sky may dim,
He will not leave to perish
One soul that clings to Him.

c
Give praise to our Redeemer, oh, magnify His grace:
Oux everlasting portion, our sure abiding place.

We have a strong deliverer,
Who trust His mighty arm;
Not all the hosts of darkness
His chosen ones can harm;
His arm that brought salvation
Defends them from above;
They rest within His mercy,
O'ershadowed by His love.

O love, that stooped from heaven
To lift us up to God,
O love, that to redeem us
The path of sorrow trod;
Through yonder land of Beulah
Glad harps with rapture ring,
And numbers without number
Its boundless triumph sing.


852
Loved with everlasting love,

Loved with everlasting love,
Led by grace that love to know;
Spirit, breathing from above,
Thou hast taught me it is so!
Oh this full and perfect peace!
Oh this transport all divine!
In a love which cannot cease,
I am His, and He is mine;
In a love which cannot cease,
I am His, and He is mine.

Heaven above is softer blue,
Earth around is sweeter green!
Something lives in every hue
Christless eyes have never seen:
Birds with gladder songs o'erflow,
Flowers with deeper beauties shine,
Since I know, as now I know,
I am His, and He is mine.

Things that once were wild alarms
Cannot now disturb my rest;
Closed in everlasting arms,
Pillowed on the loving breast.
Oh to lie for ever here,
Doubt and care and self resign,
While He whispers in my ear—
I am His, and He is mine!

His for ever, only His;
Who the Lord and me shall part!
Ah, with what a rest of bliss
Christ can fill the loving heart!
Heaven and earth may fade and flee,
First-born light in gloom decline;
But, while God and I shall be,
I am His and He is mine.


853
O Christ, in Thee my soul hath

O Christ, in Thee my soul hath found,
And found in Thee alone,
The peace, the joy I sought so long,
The bliss till now unknown.

c
Now none but Christ can satisfy,
None other name for me: . .
There's love, and life, and lasting joy
Lord Jesus, found in Thee.

I sighed for rest and happiness,
I yearned for them, not Thee;
But while I passed my Saviour by,
His love laid hold on me.

I tried the broken cisterns, Lord,
But ah! the waters failed!
E'en as I stooped to drink they'd fled,
And mocked me as I wailed.

The pleasures lost I sadly mourned,
But never wept for Thee,
Till grace the sightless eyes received
Thy loveliness to see.


854
The blessed Redeemer has found me,

The blessed Redeemer has found me,
And shattered the fetters that bound me;
Though all was confusion around me,
He came and spoke peace to my soul.
In tenderest love He hath bought me,
With patience He constantly sought me,
The way of salvation He taught me,
And made my heart perfectly whole.

c
He saves me, He saves me,
His love fills my soul, hallelujah!
I'll praise Him, I'll praise Him,
His Spirit abideth within.
He saves me. He saves me,
His love fills my soul, hallelujah!
I'll praise Him, I'll praise Him,
His blood cleanseth me from all sin.

He sought me so long ere I knew Him,
But finally winning me to Him,
I yielded my all to pursue Him,
And asked to be filled with His grace.
Although a vile sinner before Him,
Through faith I was led to implore Him,
And now I rejoice and adore Him,
Restored to His loving embrace.

I never, no, never will leave Him,
Grow weary of service and grieve Him,
I'll constantly trust and believe Him,
Secure in His presence divine.
Abiding in love ever flowing,
In knowledge and grace ever growing,
Confiding implicitly, knowing
That Jesus the Saviour is mine.


855
I hear the Saviour say,

I hear the Saviour say,
"Thy strength indeed is small;
Child of weakness, watch and pray,
Find in Me thine all in all."

c
Jesus paid it all—
All to Him I owe;
Sin had left a crimson stain;
He washed it white as snow.

Lord, now indeed I find
Thy power, and Thine alone,
Can change the leper's spots,
And melt the heart of stone.

For nothing good have I
Whereby Thy grace to claim—
I'll wash my garments white
In the blood of Calvary's Lamb.

When from my dying bed
My ransomed soul shall rise,
Then" Jesus paid it all!"
Shall rend the vaulted skies.

And when before the throne
I stand in Him complete,
I'll lay my trophies down,
All down at Jesus' feet.


856
There's a wonderful story I've heard long ago,

There's a wonderful story I've heard long ago,
'Tis called" The sweet story of old";
I hear it so often, wherever I go
That same old story is told;
And I've thought it was strange that
so often they'd tell
That story as if it were new;
But I've found out the reason they loved it so well—
That old, old story is true!

c
That old, old story is true,
That old, old story is true;
But I've found out the reason they loved it so well—
That old, old story is true!

They told of a Saviour so lovely and pure,
That came to the earth to dwell,
To seek for His lost ones, and make them secure
From death and the power of hell;
That He was despised, and with thorns He was crowned,
On the cross was extended to view;
But oh, what sweet peace in my heart since I've found
That old, old story is true!

c
But oh, what sweet peace in my heart since I've found
That old, old story is true!

He arose and ascended to heaven, we're told,
Triumphant o'er death and hell;
He's preparing a place in that city of gold,
Where loved ones for ever may dwell;
Where our kindred we'll meet, and we'll nevermore part;
And oh, while I tell it to you,
It is peace to my soul, it is joy to my heart—
That old, old story is true!

c
It is peace to my soul, it is joy to my heart-
That old, old story is true!

Oh, that wonderful story I love to repeat,
Of peace and goodwill to men;
There's no story to me that is half so sweet,
As I hear it again and again.
He invites you to come—He will freely receive,
And this message He sendeth to you,
"There's a mansion in glory for all who believe,"
That old, old story is true.

c
"There's a mansion in glory for all who believe,"
That old, old story is true!


857
I know not why God's wondrous grace

I know not why God's wondrous grace
To me hath been made known;
Nor why—unworthy as I am—
He claimed me for His own.

c
But" I know whom I have believed; and am
persuaded that He is able to keep that
which I've committed unto Him against that day."

I know not how this saving faith
To me He did impart;
Or how believing in His Word
Wrought peace within my heart.

I know not how the Spirit moves,
Convincing men of sin;
Revealing Jesus through the Word,
Creating faith in Him.

I know not what of good or ill
May be reserved for me—
Of weary ways or golden days
Before His face I see.

I know not when my Lord may come;
I know not how, nor where:
If I shall pass the vale of death,
Or" meet Him in the air."


858
In Christ is love abounding,

In Christ is love abounding,
In Him redeeming grace;
In Him my daily manna,
In Him my hiding-place.
In Him there is atonement,
In Him eternal life;
In Him a full salvation,
In Him an end of strife.

c
In Him! . . In Him! . .
There's fulness of blessing in His service sweet;
In Him! . . In Him! . .
I am in Him complete! . .

In Him I now am resting;
The half I cannot tell
Of all the priceless blessings
Which make my heart to swell
With thankful adoration,
As day by day I find
His peace and grace sufficient,
To keep both heart and mind.

But when I see Thee, Jesus,
When face to face we meet—
Then in Thine own dear image
It will be far more sweet:
Oh, then I'll sing my praises
For all I've found in Thee;
And give to Him the glory
Who has redeemed me.


859
"Nearer the cross!" my heart can say,

"Nearer the cross!" my heart can say,
I am coming nearer,
Nearer the cross from day to day,
I am coming nearer;
Nearer the cross where Jesus died,
Nearer the fountain's crimson tide,
Nearer my Saviour's wounded side,
I am coming nearer.

Nearer the Christian's mercy-seat,
I am coming nearer,
Feasting my soul on manna sweet,
I am coming nearer;
Stronger in faith, more clear I see
Jesus, who gave Himself for me;
Nearer to Him I still would be:
Still I'm coming nearer.

Nearer in prayer my hope aspires,
I am coming nearer,
Deeper the love my soul desires,
I am coming nearer;
Nearer the end of toil and care,
Nearer the joy I long to share,
Nearer the crown I soon shall wear:
I am coming nearer.


860
I know Thy hand upholdeth me,

I know Thy hand upholdeth me,
My Saviour and my God;
And step by step I'll follow Thee
Where'er Thy feet have trod.

c
I know in whom I have believed,
And, knowing, I am blest!
Thou art the Anchor of my soul—
In Thee my hope shall rest.

I know Thy hand upholdeth me,
When doubt and danger near
Would tempt me from the narrow way,
Or fill my heart with fear.

I know Thy hand upholdeth me,
And will in safety keep
My trusting heart, though I may pass
Through waters dark and deep.

I know Thy hand upholdeth me,
And will my soul defend;
Sufficient is Thy grace, O Lord,
To keep me to the end.


861
Though I my Saviour may not see,

Though I my Saviour may not see,
Yet every hour He speaks to me;
And since I made of Him my choice,
Oh, praise the Lord, I know His voice!

c
I know His voice, . . . my Saviour's voice ...
And oh, it makes . . . my heart rejoice, . . .
Whenever He . . . shall speak to me; . . .
Oh, praise the Lord! I know His voice. . . .

How often, though I see no form,
I hear His voice above the storm;
He bids the waves their tumult cease:
The sun breaks forth, and all is peace.

He speaks to me of truth and right,
Of joy and rest beyond our sight;
He speaks to me of peace and love,
And tells me of the home above.


862
I wandered in the shades of night,

I wandered in the shades of night,
Till Jesus came to me,
And with the sunlight of His love
Bid all my darkness flee.

c
Sunlight, sunlight in my soul to-day; . . .
Sunlight, sunlight all along the way; . .
Since the Saviour found me, took away my sin, . .
I have had the sunlight of His love within.

Though clouds may gather in the sky,
And billows round me roll,
However dark the world may be,
I've sunlight in my soul.

While walking in the light of God,
I sweet communion find;
I press with holy vigour on,
And leave the world behind.

I cross the wide extended fields,
I journey o'er the plain,
And in the sunlight of His love
I reap the golden grain.

Soon I shall see Him as He is,
Who gave Himself for me;
Behold the brightness of His face
Through all eternity.


863
I looked to Jesus in my sin,

I looked to Jesus in my sin,
My woe and want confessing;
Undone and lost I came to Him—
I sought and found a blessing.

c
"I looked . . to Him;" . .
'Tis true—His" Whosoever";
"He looked . . on me: . .
And we were one for ever."

I looked to Jesus on the cross;
For me I saw Him dying;
God's word believed—that all my sins
Were there upon Him lying.

I looked to Jesus there on high,
From death upraised to glory;
I trusted in His power to save,
Believed the old, old story.

He looked on me—oh, look of love!
My heart by it was broken;
And with that look of love He gave
The Holy Spirit's token.

Now one with Christ, I find my peace
In Him to be abiding;
And in His love for all my need,
In childlike faith confiding.


864
I am redeemed, oh, praise the Lord!

I am redeemed, oh, praise the Lord!
My soul, from bondage free,
Has found at last a resting-place
In Him who died for me!

c
I am redeemed! . . . I am redeemed I . . .
I'll sing it o'er and o'er;
I am redeemed! . . . Oh, praise the Lord!
Redeemed for evermore!

I looked, and lo, from Calvary's cross
A healing fountain streamed;
It cleansed my heart, and now I sing,
Praise God, I am redeemed!

The debt is paid, my soul is free;
And by His mighty power,
The blood that washed my sins away
Still cleanseth every hour.

All glory be to Jesus' name,
I know that He is mine!
For on my heart the Spirit seals
His pledge of love divine.

And when I reach that world more bright
Than mortal ever dreamed,
I'll cast my crown at Jesus' feet,
And cry, "Redeemed, redeemed!"


865
Have you on the Lord believed?

Have you on the Lord believed?
Still there's more to follow;
Of His grace have you received?
Still there's more to follow:
Oh, the grace the Father shows!
Still there's more to follow;
Freely He His grace bestows,
Still there's more to follow.

c
More and more, more and more,
Always more to follow;
Oh, His matchless, boundless love!
Still there's more to follow.

Have you felt the Saviour near?
Does His blessed presence cheer?
Oh, the love that Jesus shows!
Freely He His love bestows.

Have you felt the Spirit's power?
Falling like the gentle shower?
Oh, the power the Spirit shows!
Freely He His power bestows.


866
O happy day, that fixed my choice

O happy day, that fixed my choice
On Thee, my Saviour and my God!
Well may this glowing heart rejoice,
And tell its raptures all abroad.

c
Happy day! Happy day!
When Jesus washed my sins away!
He taught me how to watch and pray,
And live rejoicing every day;
Happy day! Happy day!
When Jesus washed my sins away!

'Tis done, the great transaction's done—
I am my Lord's, and He is mine;
He drew me, and I followed on.
Charmed to confess the voice divine.

Now rest, my long-divided heart,
Fixed on this blissful centre, rest;
Nor ever from thy Lord depart,
With Him of every good possessed.

High heaven, that heard the solemn vow,
That vow renewed shall daily hear,
Till in life's latest hour I bow,
And bless in death a bond so dear.


867
I believed in God's wonderful mercy and grace

I believed in God's wonderful mercy and grace;
Believed in the smile of His reconciled face;
Believed in His message of pardon and peace:
I believed, and I keep on believing!

c
Believe! and the" feeling" may come or may go;
Believe in the Word that was written to show
That all who believe, their salvation may know;
Believe, and keep right on believing!

I believed in the work of my crucified Lord;
Believed in redemption alone through His blood;
Believed in my Saviour by trusting His word:
I believed, and I keep on believing!

I believed in the heart that was opened for me;
Believed in the love flowing blessed and free;
Believed that my sins were all nailed to the tree:
I believed, and I keep on believing!

I believed in Himself, as the true Living One;
Believed in His presence on high on the throne;
Believed in His coming in glory full soon;
I believed, and I keep on believing!


868
All my doubts I give to Jesus!

All my doubts I give to Jesus!
I've His gracious promise heard—
I "shall never be confounded"—
I am trusting in that word.

c
I am trusting, fully trusting,
Sweetly trusting in His word;
I am trusting, fully trusting,
Sweetly trusting in His word.

All my sin I lay on Jesus!
He doth wash me in His blood;
He will keep me pure and holy,
He will bring me home to God.

All my fears I give to Jesus!
Rests my weary soul on Him;
Though my way be hid in darkness,
Never can His light grow dim.

All my joys I give to Jesus!
He is all I want of bliss;
He of all the worlds is Master—
He has all I need in this.

All I am I give to Jesus!
All my body, all my soul,
All I have, and all I hope for,
While eternal ages roll.


869
Oh, precious heavenly knowledge,

Oh, precious heavenly knowledge,
Surpassing earthly lore;
The love of God in Jesus,
In all its boundless store.

c
Known . . . and believed, ...
Gladly received, ...
Wonderful, won derfulword: ...
Dwelling in love, ...
Dwelling in God, ...
Pardoned and cleansed by the Blood . ...

By God's own Word this knowledge
To us has been revealed;
The written Word declares it,
Through Him whom God hath sealed.

By faith we have received it,
This love of God to men;
At Calvary we believed it,
When He forgave our sin.

The Spirit in us dwelling,
Bears witness from above;
The gracious message telling,
That God in Christ is love.


870
I lay my sins on Jesus,

I lay my sins on Jesus,
The spotless Lamb of God;
He bears them all, and frees us
From the accurs6d load.
I bring my guilt to Jesus.
To wash my crimson stains,
White in His blood most precious,
Till not a spot remains.

I lay my wants on Jesus,
All fulness dwells in Him;
He heals all my diseases,
He doth my soul redeem.
I lay my griefs on Jesus,
My burdens and my cares:
He from them all releases;
He all my sorrow shares.

I rest my soul on Jesus,
This weary soul of mine;
His right hand me embraces,
I on His breast recline.
I love the name of Jesus,
Immanuel, Christ, the Lord:
Like fragrance on the breezes,
His name abroad is poured.

I long to be like Jesus,
Meek, loving, lowly, mild;
I long to be like Jesus,
The Father's holy child.
I long to be with Jesus
Amid the heavenly throng,
To sing with saints His praises,
To learn the angels' song.


871
I've found a Friend; oh, such a Friend!

I've found a Friend; oh, such a Friend!
He loved me ere I knew Him;
He drew me with the cords of love,
And thus He bound me to Him.
And round my heart still closely twine
Those ties which naught can sever,
For I am His and He is mine,
For ever and for ever!

I've found a Friend; oh, such a Friend!
He bled, He died to save me;
And not alone the gift of life,
But His own self He gave me;
Naught that I have my own I call,
I hold it for the Giver:
My heart, my strength, my life, my all,
Are His, and His for ever!

I've found a Friend; oh, such a Friend!
All power to Him is given,
To guard me on my onward course,
And bring me safe to heaven.
Th' eternal glories gleam afar,
To nerve my faith endeavour:
So now to watch! to work! to war!
And then—to rest for ever!

I've found a Friend; oh, such a Friend!
So kind, and true, and tender,
So wise a Counsellor and Guide,
So mighty a Defender!
From Him, who loves me now so well,
What power my soul can sever?
Shall life? or death? or earth? or hell?
No! I am His for ever!


872
There is sunshine in my soul to-day,

There is sunshine in my soul to-day,
More glorious and bright
Than glows in any earthly sky;
For Jesus is my light.

c
Oh, there's sun shine, blessed sun shine,
When the peaceful, happy moments roll; . . .
When Jesus shows His smiling face,
There is sunshine in my soul.

There is music in my soul to-day,
A carol to my King;
And Jesus, listening, can hear
The songs I cannot sing.

There is springtime in my soul to-day;
For, when the Lord is near,
The dove of peace sings in my heart,
The flowers of grace appear.
Assurance and Testimony

There is gladness in my soul to-day,
And hope, and praise, and love;
For blessings which He gives me now,
For joys laid up above.


873
Blessed assurance—Jesus is mine!

Blessed assurance—Jesus is mine!
Oh, what a foretaste of glory divine!
Heir of salvation, purchase of God;
Born of His Spirit, washed in His blood.

c
This is my story, this is my song,
Praising my Saviour all the day long;
This is my story, this is my song,
Praising my Saviour all the day long.

Perfect submission, perfect delight,
Visions of rapture burst on my sight;
Angels descending, bring from above
Echoes of mercy, whispers of love.

Perfect submission, all is at rest,
I in my Saviour am happy and blest;
Watching and waiting, looking above,
Filled with His goodness, lost in His love.


874
What can wash away my stain?

What can wash away my stain?
Nothing but the blood of Jesus!
What can make me whole again?
Nothing but the blood of Jesus!

c
Oh, precious is the flow,
That makes me white as snow!
No other fount I know,
Nothing but the blood of Jesus!

For my cleansing this I see—
Nothing but the blood of Jesus!
For my pardon this my plea—
Nothing but the blood of Jesus!

Nothing can for sin atone—
Nothing but the blood of Jesus!
Naught of good that I have done—
Nothing but the blood of Jesus!

This is all my hope and peace—
Nothing but the blood of Jesus!
This is all my righteousness—
Nothing but the blood of Jesus!


875
I will sing the wondrous story

I will sing the wondrous story
Of the Christ who died for me;
How He left His home in glory,
For the cross on Calvary.

c
Yes, I'll sing ... the wondrous story ...
Of the Christ ... who died for me! ...
Sing it with ... the saints in glory,
Gathered by ... the crystal sea. ...

I was lost; but Jesus found me—
Found the sheep that went astray;
Threw His loving arms around me,
Drew me back into His way.

I was bruised: but Jesus healed me—
Faint was I from many a fall;
Sight was gone, and fears possessed me:
But He freed me from them all.

Days of darkness still come o'er me;
Sorrow's paths I often tread;
But the Saviour still is with me,
By His hand I'm safely led.

He will keep me till the river
Rolls its waters at my feet;
Then He'll bear me safely over,
Where the loved ones I shall meet.


876
It came to me one precious day,

It came to me one precious day,
That I had grieved my Lord away;
It smote me with a sense of loss,
And drove me to His blessed cross.

c
By faith I saw Him on the tree;
'Twas there His blood was shed for me;
And by that look, O love divine,
I now am His, and He is mine.

It came to me that joyful day,
That He would take my sins away,
If I to Him would trust my all,
And on His name but humbly call.

It came to me that golden day,
That in my heart He'd come and stay,
And there abide for evermore,
If I would open wide the door.


877
Standing on the promises of Christ my King,

Standing on the promises of Christ my King,
Through eternal ages let His praises ring;
Glory in the highest, I will shout and sing,
Standing on the promises of God.

c
Standing, . . standing, . .
Standing on the promises of God my Saviour;
Standing, . . standing, . .
I'm standing on the promises of God.

Standing on the promises that cannot fail,
When the howling storms of doubt and fear assail,
By the living word of God I shall prevail,
Standing on the promises of God.

Standing on the promises I now can see
Perfect, present cleansing in the blood for me;
Standing in the liberty where Christ makes free,
Standing on the promises of God.

Standing on the promises of Christ the Lord,
Bound to Him eternally by love's strong cord,
Overcoming daily with the Spirit's sword,
Standing on the promises of God.

Standing on the promises I cannot fall,
Listening every moment to the Spirit's call,
Resting in my Saviour as my All in all,
Standing on the promises of God.


878
How sweet, my Saviour, to repose

How sweet, my Saviour, to repose
On Thine almighty power!
To feel Thy strength upholding me,
Through every trying hour!

c
"Casting all . . your care upon Him, . . .
Casting all . . your care upon Him, . . .
Casting all . . your care upon Him, . . .
For He careth, He careth for you."

It is Thy will that I should cast
My every care on Thee;
To Thee refer each rising grief,
Each new perplexity;

That I should trust Thy loving care,
And look to Thee alone,
To calm each troubled thought to rest,
In prayer before Thy throne.

Why should my heart then be distrest,
By dread of future ill?
Or why should unbelieving fear
My trembling spirit fill?


879
Will your anchor hold in the storms of life?

Will your anchor hold in the storms of life?
When the clouds unfold their wings of strife;
When the strong tides lift and the cables strain,
Will your anchor drift, or firm remain?

c
We have an anchor that keeps the soul
Steadfast and sure while the billows roll;
Fastened to the Rock which cannot move,
Grounded firm and deep in the Saviour's love!

Will your anchor hold in the straits of fear?
When the breakers roar and the reef is near;
While the surges rave, and the wild winds blow,
Shall the angiy waves then your bark o'erflow?

Will your anchor hold in the floods of death,
When the waters cold chill your latest breath?
On the rising tide you can never fail,
While your anchor holds within the veil.

Will your eyes behold through the morning light
The city of gold, and the harbour bright?
Will you anchor safe by the heavenly shore,
When life's storms are past for evermore?


880
In ancient days, when Israel's host

In ancient days, when Israel's host
In darkest bondage lay,
The Mighty power of God was shown—
He rolled the sea away.

c
He rolls the sea away,
He rolls the sea away;
With Jesus ever near, no foe have I to fear—
He rolls the sea away.

The waves of sin swept o'er my soul,
Temptations held their sway,
The Lord spoke peace, and pardon gave—
He rolled the sea away.

Though doubts and fears obscure my path,
With Jesus I will stay;
He'll keep me near His loving heart,
And roll the sea away.

Lord Jesus, when in my last hour
I face toward realms of day,
Thy presence then shall pilot me,
And roll the sea away.


881
Now, in a song of grateful praise,

Now, in a song of grateful praise,
To my dear Lord my voice I'll raise;
With all His saints I'll join to tell,
My Jesus has done all things well!

c
And above the rest this note shall swell,
This note shall swell, this note shall swell;
And above the rest this note shall swell:
My Jesus has done all things well!

How sovereign, wonderful, and free,
Has been His love to sinful me!
He plucked me from the jaws of hell:
My Jesus has done all things well!

Though many a fiery flaming dart
The tempter levels at my heart—
With this I all his rage repel:
My Jesus has done all things well!

And when to that bright world I rise,
And claim my mansion in the skies,
Above the rest this note shall swell:
My Jesus has done all things well!


882
I hear the words of love,

I hear the words of love,
I gaze upon the blood,
I see the mighty Sacrifice,
And I have peace with God.

'Tis everlasting peace!
Sure as Jehovah's name;
Tis stable as His steadfast throne,
For evermore the same.

The clouds may go and come,
And storms may sweep my sky—
This blood-sealed friendship changes not:
The cross is ever nigh.

My love is ofttimes low,
My joy still ebbs and flows;
But peace with Him remains the same—
No change Jehovah knows,

I change, He changes not,
The Christ can never die;
His love, not mine, the resting-place,
His truth, not mine, the tie.


883
I'm not ashamed to own my Lord,

I'm not ashamed to own my Lord,
Or to defend His cause;
Maintain the honour of His Word,
The glory of His cross.

c
At the cross! at the cross!
where I first saw the light,
And the burden of my heart rolled away; ...
It was there by faith I received my sight,
And now I am happy all the day!

Jesus, my God! I know His name—
His name is all my trust:
Nor will He put my soul to shame,
Nor let my hope be lost.

Firm as His throne His promise stands;
And He can well secure
What I've committed to His hands,
Till the decisive hour.

Then He will own my worthless name
Before His Father's face;
And in the new Jerusalem
Appoint my soul a place.


884
Till I learned to love Thy name,

Till I learned to love Thy name,
Lord, Thy grace denying,
I was lost in sin and shame,
Dying, dying, dying!

c
Hallelujah! grace is free,
This is now my story;
Jesus' blood avails for me—
Glory! glory! glory I

Peace the world could not impart,
Dark and drear the morrow;
In my sad and weary heart,
Sorrow, sorrow, sorrow I

When I learned to love Thy name
O Thou meek and lowly!
Rapture kindled to a flame—
"Holy, holy, holy!"

Oh, that all the earth might ring
With salvation's story,
Till before the throne I sing,
Glory! glory! glory!


885
Life wears a different face to me,

Life wears a different face to me,
Since I found my Saviour;
Rich mercy at His cross I see,
My kind and loving Saviour.

c
Doubts and fears have passed away,
Jesus turns my night to day;
Heaven seems not so far away,
Since I found my Saviour.

He sought me in His wondrous love,
Thus I found my Saviour;
He brought salvation from above,
My own, my precious Saviour.

Though passing clouds have intervened
Since I found my Saviour,
Yet He is with me, though unseen,
My ever-present Saviour.

His hand still firmly holds my own,
Since I found my Saviour;
He leads me onward to the throne,
Oh, there I'll see my Saviour!


886
I've found a joy in sorrow,

I've found a joy in sorrow,
A secret balm for pain,
A beautiful to-morrow
Of sunshine after rain;
I've found a branch of healing
Near every bitter spring,
A whispered promise stealing
O'er every broken string.

I've found a glad hosanna
For every woe and wail;
A handful of sweet manna
When grapes of Eshcol fail;
I've found a Rock of Ages
When desert wells are dry;
And, after weary stages,
I've found an Elim nigh.

An Elim with its coolness,
Its fountains, and its shade;
A blessing in its fulness,
When buds of promise fade.
O'er tears of soft contrition
I've seen a rainbow light,
A glory and fruition,
So near! —yet out of sight.

My Saviour, Thee possessing,
I have the joy, the balm,
The healing and the blessing,
The sunshine and the psalm;
The promise for the fearful,
The Elim for the faint;
The rainbow for the tearful,
The glory for the saint!


887
I am walking on the waves!

I am walking on the waves!
For my blest Redeemer saves,
As I look with trustful eye unto Him:
He upholds me all the way,
And my heart is bright as day,
For 'tis lit by heaven's ray—never dim.

c
I am walking on the waves!
For my great Redeemer saves:
I am walking with my Lord, on the waves.

I am walking on the waves!
In my weakness Jesus saves,
As I fully trust in Him every hour:
He supports me with His arms,
And He quiets my alarms,
And He Satan's hosts disarms, by His power.

I am walking on the waves!
In my sorrows Jesus saves,
As I everything resign to His will:
All my burdens He doth bear,
Every trouble He doth share—
So my heart is free from care, and is still.

I am walking on the waves!
In temptations Jesus saves,
As I trust His keeping grace all the day;
For He always fights for me,
And He gives me victory—
So I sing rejoicingly, all the way.


888
I will tell the precious story,

I will tell the precious story,
And proclaim the wondrous love
Of my Saviour now in glory,
Seated on His throne above;
Once He came, despised, rejected,
Everlasting life to bring;
Now exalted Prince and Saviour—
He is Salem's mighty King!

c
He is Je - - sus crucified;
For am-- ined world He died!
Now He reigns in heaven for ever
With the saved and glorified.

Though His name is high and holy,
And His kingdom so secure,
Yet He dwells with all the lowly,
If their hearts are only pure;
Never yet was love so tender,
Never promise half so sweet,
Peace He gives when we surrender,
Sitting meekly at His feet.

When by sin and anguish driven
With our needs before the throne,
If we ask for bread from heaven,
Will He give to us a stone?
No: He'll hear our sad repining,
For He feels our every woe;
And will pour us out a blessing,
That will surely overflow.

Do you fear the coming morrow,
With its crosses yet unknown?
Have you any care or sorrow
That you cannot bear alone?
Do not yield to sad complaining,
All your burdens on Him cast;
Let your light be ever shining,
Faith will bring you home at last.


889
Oh, how happy are they Who the Saviour obey,

Oh, how happy are they
Who the Saviour obey,
And have laid up their treasures above!
Tongue can never express
The sweet comfort and peace
Of a soul in its earliest love.

That sweet comfort was mine,
When the favour divine
I received through the blood of the Lamb;
When my heart first believed,
What a joy I received,
What a heaven in Jesus's name!

'Twas a heaven below
My Redeemer to know;
And the angels could do nothing more
Than to fall at His feet,
And the story repeat,
And the Lover of sinners adore.

Jesus all the day long
Was my joy and my song;
Oh that all His salvation might see!
"He hath loved me, "I cried;
"He hath suffered and died
To redeem even rebels like me."

Oh, the rapturous height
Of that holy delight
Which I felt in the life-giving blood!
Of my Saviour possessed,
I was perfectly blessed,
As if filled with the fulness of God.


890
I know that Jesus ever lives,

I know that Jesus ever lives,
And has prepared a place for me;
And crowns of victory He gives
To those who would His children be.

c
Then ask me not to linger long
Amid the gay and thoughtless throng;
For I am only waiting here
To hear the summons:" Child, come home!"

I'm trusting Jesus Christ for all,
I know His blood now speaks for me;
I'm listening for the welcome call,
To say:" The Master waiteth thee!"

I'm now enraptured with the thought—
I stand and wonder at His love—
That He from heaven to earth was brought
To die, that I might live above.

I know that Jesus soon will come;
I know the time will not be long,
Till I shall reach my heavenly home,
And join the everlasting song.


891
Hallelujah! Jesus saves me;

Hallelujah! Jesus saves me;
Oh, the sweet and precious story!
I will give Him all the glory,
And adore His love to me.

c
From oppression He has brought me;
From its bonds has set me free;
I will praise Him for His mercy;
Grace divine my song shall be.

Hallelujah! Jesus hears me;
When in prayer His throne addressing,
While in faith I seek His blessing,
Then His smile revealed I see.

Hallelujah! Jesus leads me;
I will doubt His promise never,
But believing, follow ever
Him who gave His life for me.

Hallelujah! Jesus keeps me;
In the Rock He safely hides me,
Every comfort He provides me,
Never friend so dear as He.


892
I know that my Redeemer lives,

I know that my Redeemer lives,
And ever prays for me;
A token of His love He gives,
A pledge of liberty.

I find Him lifting up my head;
He brings salvation near:
His presence makes me free indeed;
And He will soon appear.

He wills that I should holy be:
What can withstand His will?
The counsel of His grace in me
He surely shall fulfil.

Jesus, I hang upon Thy word:
I steadfastly believe
Thou wilt return, and claim me, Lord.
And to Thyself receive.


893
Majestic sweetness sits enthroned

Majestic sweetness sits enthroned
Upon the Saviour's brow;
His head with radiant glories crowned,
His lips with grace o'erflow.

No mortal can with Him compare
Among the sons of men;
Fairer is He than all the fair
That fill the heavenly train.

He saw me plunged in deep distress,
He flew to my relief;
For me He bore the shameful cross,
And carried all my grief.

To Him I owe my life and breath,
And all the joys I have;
He makes me triumph over death,
He saves me from the grave.

To heaven, the place of His abode,
He brings my weary feet;
Shows me the glories of my God,
And makes my joy complete.

Since from His bounty I receive
Such proofs of love divine,
Had I a thousand hearts to give,
Lord, they should all be Thine!


894
Amazing grace! how sweet the sound

Amazing grace! how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me;
I once was lost, but now am found;
Was blind, but now I see.

'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear,
And grace my fears relieved;
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed!

Through many dangers, toils, and snares,
I have already come:
*Tis grace that brought me safe thus far,
And grace will lead me home.

Yes, when this heart and flesh shall fail,
And mortal life shall cease,
I shall possess within the vail
A life of joy and peace.


895
Far away my steps had wandered,

Far away my steps had wandered,
Long in paths of sin I strayed,
Till my wayward heart deceived me,
And the world my trust betrayed:
Then I cried, "There's none can help me,
None whose love can soothe my woe,"
When I heard a voice that whispered,
"Child, I loved thee iong ago."

c
"Long ago, . . long ago; ...
Child, I loved thee long ago;
"Oh, how sweet the voice that whispered,
"Child, I loved . . thee long ago!"

Through His mercy He received me,
All my sins He washed away;
At His feet I knelt and praised Him
For the joy I found that day.
Now amid the verdant pastures,
Where the tranquil waters flow,
Still Ihear His voice repeating,
"Child. I loved thee long ago."

Come to Him, O heavy laden,
Only trust, and He'll forgive;
To the cross, where once He suffered,
Lo, He bids thee look and live.
If by faith and true repentance
Thou wilt ask His love to know—
Surely thou wilt hear Him answer,
"Child, I loved thee long ago."


896
I will sing of my Redeemer,

I will sing of my Redeemer,
And His wondrous love to me;
On the cruel cross He suffered,
From the curse to set me free.

c
Sing, oh sing ... of my Redeemer!...
With His blood ... He purchased me I .
On the cross ... He sealed my pardon,
Paid the debt, ... and made me free ...

I will tell the wondrous story,
How my lost estate to save,
In His boundless love and mercy,
He the ransom freely gave.

I will praise my dear Redeemer,
His triumphant power I'll tell;
How the victory He giveth
Over sin, and death, and hell.

I will sing of my Redeemer,
And His heavenly love to me;
He from death to life hath brought me,
Son of God, with Him to be.


897
I once was a stranger to grace and to God;

I once was a stranger to grace and to God;
I knew not my danger, and felt not my load;
Though friends spoke in rapture of Christ on the tree,
"Jehovah Tsidkenu" was nothing to me.

Like tears from the daughters of Zion that roll,
I wept when the waters went over His soul,
Yet thought not that my sins had nailed to the tree
"Jehovah Tsidkenu"—'twas nothing to me.

When free grace awoke me, by light from on high,
Then legal fears shook me, I trembled to die;
No refuge, no safety, in self could I see;
"Jehovah Tsidkenu" my Saviour must be.

My terrors all vanished before thesweet name;
My guilty fears banished, with boldness I came
To drink at the fountain, life-giving and free:
"Jehovah Tsidkenu" was all things to me.

E'en treading the valley, the shadow of death,
This watchword shall rally my faltering breath;
For, when from life's fever my God sets me free,
"Jehovah Tsidkenu" my death-song shall be.


898
O brother, have you told how the Lord forgave?

O brother, have you told how the Lord forgave?
Let us hear you tell it over once again;
Thy coming to the cross where He died to save,
Let us hear you tell it over once again.
Are you walking now in His blessed light?
Are you cleansed from every guilty stain?
Is He your joy by day and your song by night?
Let us hear you tell it over once again.

c
Let us hear ... you tell it over, ... tell it
over once again; ...
Tell the sweet and blessed story,
It will help you on to glory—
Let us hear you tell it over once again.

When toiling up the way, was the Saviour there?
Let us hear you tell it over once again;
Did Jesus bear you up in His tender care?
Let us hear you tell it over once again.
Never have you found such a friend as He,
Who can help you 'midst the toil and pain;
Oh, all the world should hear what He's done for thee;
Let us hear you tell it over once again.

Was ever on your tongue such a bless6d theme?
Let us hear you tell it over once again;
'Tis ever sweeter far than the sweetest dream—
Let us hear you tell it over once again.
There are aching hearts in the world's great throng,
Who have sought for rest, and all in vain;
Hold Jesus up to them by your word and song;
Let us hear you tell it over once again.

The battles you have fought and the victories won,
Let us hear you tell it over once again;
Twill help them on the way who have just begun—
Let us hear you tell it over once again.
We are striving now with the hosts of sin, .
Soon with Christ our Saviour we shall reign;
Ye ransomed of the Lord, try a soul to win;
Let us hear you tell it over ones again.


899
I will praise the Lord with heart and voice,

I will praise the Lord with heart and voice,
And in Him I will rejoice;
I will sing His wondrous love to me,
And this my song shall be:

c
He hath taken . all . my sins away; . .
Praise His holy name! Praise His holy came
He hath taken . all . my sins away, ...
Hallelujah to His name!

When I came, with all my sin opprest,
Unto Him for peace and rest,
Then He heard my prayer and set me free,
And this my song shall be:

I will praise Him with my latest breath,
For the victory over death;
I will praise Him through eternity,
And this my song shall be:


900
Jesus, my All, to heaven is gone,

Jesus, my All, to heaven is gone,
He whom I fixed my hopes upon;
His track I see, and I'll pursue
The narrow way, till Him I view.

The way the holy prophets went,
The road that leads from banishment,
The King's highway of holiness,
I'll go, for all His paths are peace.

This is the way I long have sought.
And mourned because I found it not;
My grief and burden long have been,
Because I could not cease from sin.

The more I strove against its power,
I sinned and stumbled but the more;
Till late I heard my Saviour say,
"Come hither, soul, I am the Way."

Lo! glad I come; and Thou, blest Lamb,
Shalt take me to Thee as I am;
Nothing but sin have I to give;
Nothing but love shall I receive.

Now will I tell to sinners round
What a dear Saviour I have found;
I'll point to Thy redeeming blood,
And say, "Behold the way to God."


901
When peace, like a river, attendeth my way,

When peace, like a river, attendeth my way,
When sorrows, like sea-billows,roll;
Whatever my lot, Thou hast taught me to know,
"It is well, it is well with my soul."

c
It is well . . . with my soul, . . .
It is well, it is well with my soul.

Though Satan should buffet, though trials should come,
Let this blest assurance control,
That Christ hath regarded my helpless estate,
And hath shed His own blood for my soul.

My sin—oh, the bliss of this glorious thought!
My sin—not in part, but the whole,
Is nailed to His cross; and I bear it no more:
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,O my soul!

For me, be it Christ, be it Christ hence to live!
If Jordan above me shall roll,
No pang shall be mine, for in death as in life
Thou wilt whisper Thy peace to my soul.

But, Lord, 'tis for Thee, for Thy coming, we wait;
The sky, not the grave, is our goal:
Oh, trump of the Angel! oh, voice of the Lord!
Blessed hope! blessed rest of my soul!


902
My hope is built on nothing less

My hope is built on nothing less
Than Jesus' blood and righteousness;
I dare not trust the sweetest frame,
But wholly lean on Jesus' name.

c
On Christ, the solid Rock, I stand;
All other ground is sinking sand,
All other ground is sinking sand.

When darkness hides His lovely face,
I rest on His unchanging grace;
In every high and stormy gale,
My anchor holds within the vail.

His oath, His covenant, His blood,
Support me in the 'whelming flood;
When all around my soul gives way,
He then is all my hope and stay.

When He shall come with trumpet sound,
On ,may I then in Him be found,
Clothed in His righteousness alone,
Faultless to stand before the throne!


903
Drawing near with full assurance;

Drawing near with full assurance;
Ah, my soul, how can it be?
How canst thou, condemned and sinful,
Think of God as near to thee?

c
Full assurance! I am trusting
In a Saviour crucified;
Full assurance! Jesus saved me,
When upon the cross He died.

He is faithful that has promised;
Here my soul has found its rest,
And by fully trusting Jesus,
With assurance I am blest.

Sins to be no more remembered,
Full remission in His blood,
Made by Him an heir of heaven,
Made by Him a child of God.

So I come, my sins confessing,
Boldly come, without a fear;
All my right in Christ possessing,
To the Father drawing near.


904
There's not a friend like the lowly Jesus,

There's not a friend like the lowly Jesus,
No, not one! no, not one!
None else could heal all our soul's diseases,
No, not one! no, not one!

c
Jesus knows all about our struggles,
He will guide till the day is done;
There's not a friend like the lowly Jesus,
No, not one! no, not one!

No friend like Him is so high and holy,
No, not one! no, not one!
And yet no friend is so meek and lowly,
No, not one! no, not one!

There's not an hour that He is not near us,
No, not one! no, not one!
No night so dark but His love can cheer us,
No, not one! no, not one!

Did ever saint find this Friend forsake him?
No, not one! no, not one!
Or sinner find that He would not take him?
No, not one! no, not one!

Was e'er a gift like the Saviour given?
No, not one! no, not one!
Will He refuse us a home in heaven?
No, not one! no, not one!


905
Jesus! and shall it ever be,

Jesus! and shall it ever be,
A mortal man ashamed of Thee?
Ashamed of Thee, whom angels praise,
Whose glories shine through endless days!

Ashamed of Jesus! that dear Friend
On whom my hopes ofheaven depend?
No; when I blush, be this my shame,
That I no more revere His name.

Ashamed of Jesus! yes, I may,
When I've no guilt to wash away;
No tear to wipe, no good to crave,
No fears to quell, no soul to save.

Till then—nor is my boasting vain—
Till then, I boast a Saviour slain!
And oh, may this my glory be,
That Christ is not ashamed of me!


906
I was once far away from the Saviour,

I was once far away from the Saviour,
As vile as a sinner could be,
And I wondered if Christ the Redeemer,
Could save a poor sinner like me.

I wandered on in the darkness,
Not a ray of light could I see;
And the thought filled my heart with sadness,
There's no hope for a sinner like me.

And then, in that dark lonely hour,
A voice sweetly whispered to me,
Saying, "Look unto Me! —I have power
To save a poor sinner like thee."

I listened: and lo! 'twas the Saviour
That was speaking so kindly to me;
And I cried, "I'm the chief of sinners;
Canst Thou save a poor sinner like me?"

I then fully trusted in Jesus;
And oh, now a joy came to me!
My heart was filled with His praises,
For saving a sinner like me.

No longer in darkness I'm walking,
The light is now shining on me;
And now unto others I'm telling,
How He saved a poor sinner like me.

And when life's journey is over,
And I the dear Saviour shall see,
I'll praise Him for ever and ever,
For saving a sinner like me!


907
Give me the wings of faith to rise

Give me the wings of faith to rise
Within the vail, and see
The saints above, how great their joys,
How bright their glories be.

c
Many are the friends who are waiting to-day,
Happy on the golden strand;
Many are the voices calling us away
To join their glorious band
Calling us away, calling us away,
Calling to the better land.

Once they were mourners here below,
And poured out cries and tears;
They wrestled hard, as we do now,
With sins, and doubts, and fears.

I ask them whence their victory came:
They, with united breath,
Ascribe their conquest to the Lamb,
Their triumph to His death.

908
Beautiful valley of Eden

Beautiful valley of Eden!
Sweet is thy noontide calm,
Over the hearts of the weary,
Breathing thy waves of balm.

c
Beautiful valley of Eden!
Home of the pure and blest, ...
How often, amid the wild billows,
I dream of thy rest—sweet rest!

Over the heart of the mourner
Shineth thy golden day,
Wafting the songs of the angels
Down from the far-away.

There is the home of my Saviour,
There, with the blood-washed throng,
Over the highlands of glory
Rolleth the great new song.


909
When I shall wake in that fair morn of morns

When I shall wake in that fair morn of morns,
After whose dawning never night returns,
And with whose glory day eternal burns —
I shall be satisfied, be satisfied!

c
I shall be satisfied, I shall be satisfied,
When I shall wake in that fair morn of morns
 Ishall be satisfied, I shall be satisfied,
When I shall wake in that fair morn of morns

When I shall see Thy glory face to face,
When in Thine arms Thou wilt Thy child embrace,
When Thou shalt open all Thy store of grace —
I shall be satisfied, be satisfied!

When I shall meet with those that I have loved,
Clasp in my arms the dear ones long removed,
And find how faithful Thou to me hast proved —
I shall be satisfied, be satisfied!

When I shall gaze upon the face of Him
Who died for me, with eye no longer dim,
And praise Him with the everlasting hymn —
I shall be satisfied, be satisfied!


910
Oh for the peace that floweth as a river

Oh for the peace that floweth as a river,
Making life's desert places bloom and smile;
Oh for the faith to grasp Heaven's bright"for ever, "
Amid the shadows of earth's" little while."

"A little while" for patient vigil keeping,
To face the storm and wrestle with the strong;
"A little while" to sow the seed with weeping,
Then bind the sheaves and sing the harvest song.

"A little while" the earthen pitcher taking
To wayside brooks, from far-off mountains fed;
Then the parched lip its thirst for ever slaking
Beside the fulness of the Fountain head.

"A little while" to keep the oil from failing,
"A little while" faith's flickering lamp to trim,
And then the Bridegroom's coming footsteps hailing,
We'll haste to meet Him with the bridal hymn.


911
Gliding o'er life's fitful waters

Gliding o'er life's fitful waters,
Heavy surges sometimes roll;
And we sigh for yonder haven,
For the Home-land of the soul.

c
Blessed Home-land, ever fair!
Sin can never enter there;
But the soul, to life awaking,
Everlasting joy shall share.

Oft we catch a faint reflection
Of its bright and vernal hills;
And though distant, how we hail it!
How each heart with rapture thrills!

To our Father, and our Saviour,
To the Spirit, Three in One,
We shall sing glad songs of triumph
When our harvest work is done.


Tis the weary pilgrim's Home-land,
Where each throbbing care shall cease,
And our longings and our yearnings,
Like the waves, be hushed to peace.


912
Shall we all meet at home in the morning

Shall we all meet at home in the morning,
On the shores of the bright crystal sea,
With the loved ones who long have been waiting?
What a meeting indeed it will be!

c
Gathered home! ... gathered home! ...
On the shores of the bright crystal sea!
Gathered home! ... gathered home! ...
With our loved ones for ever to be!

Shall we all meet at home in the morning,
And from sorrow for ever be free?
Shall we join in the songs of the ran- somed?
What a meeting indeed!

Shall we all meet at home in the morning,
Our blessed Redeemer to see?
Shall we know and be known by our loved ones?
What a meeting indeed it will be!


913
Shall we meet beyond the river

Shall we meet beyond the river,
Where the surges cease to roll?
Where, in all the bright" for ever,"
Sorrow ne'er shall press the soul?

c
Shall we meet? shall we meet?
Shall we meet? shall we meet?
Shall we meet beyond the river,
Where the surges cease to roll?

Shall we meet in that blest harbour,
When our stormy voyage is o'er?
Shall we meet and cast the anchor
By the fair celestial shore?

Shall we meet in yonder city,
Where the towers of crystal shine?
Where the walls are all of jasper,
Built by workmanship divine?

Where the music of the ransomed
Rolls its harmony around,
And creation swells the chorus
With its sweet melodious sound?

Shall we meet with many a loved one
That was torn from our embrace?
Shall we listen to their voices,
And behold them face to face?

Shall we meet with Christ our Saviour,
When He comes to claim His own?
Shall we know His blessed favour,
And sit down upon His throne?


914
OH to be over yonder

OH to be over yonder,
In that bright land of wonder,
Where the angel-voices mingle, and the angel-harps do ring!
To be free from care and sorrow,
And the anxious, dread to-morrow,
To rest in light and sunshine in the presence of the King!

c
Oh ... to be over yonder!
In . . that land of wonder, . .
There . . to be for ever
In the presence of the King!

Oh to be over yonder!
My longing heart grows fonder
Of looking to the far-off east, to see the day-star bring
Some tidings of the awaking —
Of the cloudless, pure daybreaking:
My heart is yearning—yearning for the coming of the King.

Oh to be over yonder!
Alas! I sigh and ponder —
Why clings this poor weak heart of mine to any earthly thing?
For each earthly tie must sever,
And pass away for ever:
There's no more separation in the presence of the King!

Oh, when shall I be dwelling
Where angel voices, swelling
In triumphant hallelujahs, make the vaulted heavens ring?—
Where the pearly gates are gleaming,
And the Morning Star is beaming?
Oh, when shall I be yonder in the presence of the King?

Oh, when shall I be yonder?
The longing groweth stronger
To join in all the praises the redeemed ones do sing,
Within those heavenly places,
Where the angels veil their faces,
In awe and adoration, in the presence of the King!


915
In robes made white through Jesus' blood

In robes made white through Jesus' blood,
We soon shall meet beyond the flood,
And hold sweet converse, free from pain,
Nor ever fear to part again,
Beyond the swelling flood!

c
Beyond . . the swelling flood!
Beyond . . the swelling flood!
Beyond . . the swelling flood,
We'll meet to part no more!
Beyond the swelling flood!

I fear not now what ills may come:
By faith I see my heavenly home,
And hear the angel voices say,
"Thy God shall wipe all tears away,"
Beyond the swelling flood!

O meeting blest, with friends so dear!
What sounds shall greet the listening ear!
What thrills of rapture wake the soul
As back those golden gates shall roll,
Beyond the swelling flood!

Dear Saviour, guide my willing feet,
That I may have that joy complete;
And live to praise through endless day
The love that dries all tears away,
Beyond the swelling flood!


916
Only a few more years

Only a few more years,
Only a few more cares;
nly a few more smiles and tears,
Only a few more prayers,

Only a few more wrongs,
Only a few more sighs;
Only a few more earthly songs,
Only a few good-byes.

Then an eternal stay;
Then an eternal throng;
Then an eternal, glorious day;
Then an eternal song!


917
"For ever with the Lord!"

"For ever with the Lord!"
Amen, so let it be;
Life from the dead is in that word,
'Tis immortality.
Here in the body pent,
Absent from Him I roam,
Yet nightly pitch my moving tent,
A day's march nearer home.

c
Nearer home, nearer home,
A day's march nearer home.

My Father's house on high,
Home of my soul; how near
At times to faith's foreseeing eye
Thy golden gates appear!
Ah, then my spirit faints
To reach the land I love;
The bright inheritance of saints,
Jerusalem above.

Yet clouds will intervene,
And all my prospect flies;
Like Noah's dove, I flit between
Rough seas and stormy skies.
Anon the clouds depart,
The winds and waters cease;
While sweetly o'er my gladdened heart
Expands the bow of peace,

I hear at morn and even,
At noon and midnight hour —
The choral harmonies of heaven
Earth's Babel-tongues o'erpower —
That resurrection word,
That shout of victory,
Once more:"For ever with the Lord!
Amen, so let it be!


918
For thee, O dear, dear country

For thee, O dear, dear country,
Mine eyes their vigils keep;
For very love, beholding
Thy happy name, they weep.
The mention of thy glory
Is unction to the breast,
And medicine in sickness,
And love, and life, and rest.

With jasper glow thy bulwarks,
Thy streets with emeralds blaze;
The sardius and the topaz
Unite in thee their rays;
Thine ageless walls are bonded
With amethyst unpriced;
The saints build up its fabric,
The cornerstone is Christ.

Thou hast no shore, fair ocean;
Thou hast no time, bright day;
Dear fountain of refreshment
To pilgrims far away:
Upon the Rock of Ages
They raise thy holy tower;
Thine is the victor's laurel,
And thine the golden dower.

Oh, sweet and blessed country,
The home of God's elect!
Oh, sweet and blessed country,
That eager hearts expect!
Jesus, in mercy bring us
To that dear land of rest,
Who art, with God the Father,
And Spirit, ever blest.


919
Oh, glorious hope of perfect love!

Oh, glorious hope of perfect love!
It lifts me up to things above;
It bears on eagle's wings;
It gives my ravished soul a taste,
And makes me for some moments feast
With Jesus' priests and kings.

Rejoicing now in earnest hope,
I stand, and from the mountain-top
See all the land below:
Rivers of milk and honey rise,
And all the fruits of paradise
In endless plenty grow.

A land of corn, and wine, and oil.
Favoured with God's peculiar smile,
With every blessing blest;
There dwells the Lord our Righteousness,
And keeps His own in perfect peace
And everlasting rest.

Oh, that at once I might go up!
No more on this side Jordan stop,
But now the land possess:
This moment end my legal years,
Sorrows, and sins, and doubts, and fears,
A howling wilderness.

Now, O my Joshua, bring me in!
Cast out Thy foes; the inward sin,
The stony heart remove;
The purchase of Thy death divide;
And oh, with all the sanctified,
Give me Thy perfect love.


920
Oh land of rest, for thee I sigh!

Oh land of rest, for thee I sigh!
When will the moment come,
When I shall lay my armour by,
And dwell in peace at home?

c
We'll work . . till Jesus comes;
We'll work . . till Jesus comes;
We'll work . . till Jesus comes;
And we'll be gathered home.

No tranquil joys on earth I know,
No peaceful sheltering dome;
This world's a wilderness of woe,
This world is not my home.

To Jesus Christ I fled for rest:
He bade me cease to roam,
And lean for succour on His breast,
Till He conduct me home.

 Isought at once my Saviour's side:
No more my steps shall roam;
With Him I'll brave death's chilling tide,
And reach my heavenly home.


921
I sail in the light that shines

I sail . . in the light . . . that shines . .
from the cross, . . .
Right o'er life's troubled sea; . . .
I steer my soul to glory's goal
By the rays from Calvary. . . .

c
Then sail in the light, . . .
Oh, sail in the light, . . .
Ye children of the Gospel day; . .
From Cal - - vary's cross
To glo - - ry's crown
Ye have the light alway. . . .

I sail . . in the light . . . that shines . .
from the cross, . . .
And by that light I see . . .
The visage fair of Him who there
Laid down His life for me. . . .

I sail . . in the light . . . that shines ...
from the cross, . . .
So bright it shines for me; . . .
Its beams will guide safe o'er the tide
To the land where I would be. . . .


922
The home beyond the shadows,

The home beyond the shadows,
Where all is calm and still;
Where holy joy and gladness
The troubled heart shall fill:
I'm longing for the Homeland,
With golden gates so fair,
That ever stand wide open
To welcome pilgrims there.

The home beyond the shadows,
Beyond the crystal sea;
The home of many mansions,
Where rest remains for me:
I'm waiting, only waiting,
Its hallowed peace to share;
I long its gates to enter,
With loved ones gathered there.

The home beyond the shadows
Hath neither pain nor tears;
But through its cloudless regions
The Light of Life appears —
Dispelling every sorrow,
Removing every care,
And giving rest eternal
To all who enter there.


923
We speak of the land of the blest

We speak of the land of the blest,
That country so bright and so fair,
And oft are its glories confessed;
But what must it be to be there!

c
To be there! ... to be there! . . .
Oh, what must it be to be there! . . .
To be there! ... to be there! . .
Oh, what must it be to be there!

We speak of its pathways of gold,
Its walls decked with jewels so rare,
Its wonders and pleasures untold;
But what must it be to be there!

We speak of its peace and its love,
The robes which the glorified wear,
The songs of the blessed above;
But what must it be to be there!

We speak of its freedom from sin,
From sorrow, temptation, and care,
From trials without and within;
But what must it be to be there!

Do Thou, Lord, in pleasure or woe,
For heaven our spirits prepare;
Then shortly we also shall know,
And feel what it is to be there!


924
There is a home eternal

There is a home eternal,
Beautiful and bright,
Where sweet joys supernal
Never are dimmed by night;
White-robed angels are singing
Ever around the bright throne;
When, oh, when shall I see thee,
Beautiful, beautiful Home?

c
Home! beautiful Home! . . .
Bright, beautiful Home! . . .
Bright Home of our Saviour,
Bright, . . beautiful Home!

Flowers are ever springing
In that Home so fair;
Little children singing
Praises to Jesus there.
How they swell the glad anthem,
Ever around the bright throne!
When, oh, when shall I see thee,
Beautiful, beautiful Home?

Soon shall I join the ransomed,
Far beyond the sky;
Christ is my salvation,
Why should I fear to die?
Soon my eyes shall behold Him
Seated upon the bright throne;
Then, oh then, shall I see thee,
Beautiful, beautiful Home!


925
We would see Jesus—for the shadows lengthen

We would see Jesus—for the shadows lengthen
Across this little landscape of our life;
We would see Jesus, our weak faith to strengthen
For the last weariness—the final strife.

We would see Jesus—the great Rock foundation,
Whereon our feet were set with sovereign grace;
Not life, nor death, with all their agitation,
Can thence remove us, if we see His face.

We would see Jesus—other lights are paling,
Which for long years we have rejoiced to see;
The blessings of our pilgrimage are failing:
We would not mourn them, for we go to Thee.

We would see Jesus—this is all we're needing,
Strength, joy, and willingness, come with the sight;
We would see Jesus, dying, risen, pleading,
Then welcome, day, and farewell, mortal night!


926
I would not live alway: I ask not to stay

I would not live alway: I ask not to stay
Where storm after storm rises dark o'er the way;
The few lurid mornings that dawn on us here
Are enough for life's woes, full enough for its cheer.

I would not live alway, thus fettered by sin
Temptation without, and corruption within:
E'en the rapture of pardon is mingled with fears,
And the cup of thanksgiving with penitent tears.

I would not live alway: no, welcome the tomb!
Since Jesus hath lain there I dread not its gloom;
There sweet be my rest, till He bid me arise
To hail Him in triumph descend from the skies.

Who, who would live alway, away from his God,
Away from yon heaven, that blissful abode,
Where the rivers of pleasure flow o'er the bright plains,
And the noontide of glory eternally reigns?

Where the saints of all ages in harmony meet,
Their Saviour and brethren transported to greet;
While the anthems of rapture unceasingly roll,
And the smile of the Lord is the feast of the soul!


927
After the darkest hour

After the darkest hour
The morning draweth nigh;
After the tempest's power,
The clear blue sky.

After the drifting snow,
The sunny days of calm;
After the crushing blow,
God's healing balm.

After the sad good-bye
New friends around us throng;
After the burdened sigh,
The sweetest song.

After the cross of tears,
The crown of joy is given;
After earth's weary years,
The rest of heaven.


928
We are march --- ing to a city

We are marching to a city
On the hill ... of Zion fair;
With its beauty and its splendour,
There's no other can compare: ...
Soon with all ... the ransomed army,
In their pure ... and bright array,
We shall gather in the morning,
Where the shadows flee away. . . .

By the martyrs and apostles,
And the holy men of old,
Will the story of redemption
Through eternal years be told:
We shall hear and join the chorus
In that realm of endless day,
When we gather in the morning,
Where the shadows flee away.

There are voices we remember,
There are friends we dearly love;
We shall meet them at the portals
Of that city built above:
And our Saviour's" Come, ye blessed!"
All our trials will repay,
When we gather in the morning,
Where the shadovs flee away.


929
Tis only a little way on to my home

'Tis only a little way on to my home,
And there in its sunshine for ever I'll roam;
While all the day long I journey with song,
O beautiful Edenland, thou art my home!

c
'Tis only a little way, only a little way;
'Tis only a little way on to my home.

'Tis only a little way farther to go,
O'er mountain and valley where dark waters flow ;
My Saviour is near, with blessings to cheer;
His word is my guiding-star— why should I fear?

'Tis only a little way: there I shall see
The friends that in glory are waiting for me;
Their voices from home now float on the air -
They're calling me tenderly, calling me there.


930
Far away beyond the shadows

Far away beyond the shadows,
Through the rifting clouds above,
Floods of golden light are breaking
From a world where all is love.

c
Far away beyond the shadows,
Through the gates that never close,
There the King Himself will lead us
Where the living water flows.

Far away beyond the shadows,
There a bright and joyful throng
Wave their palms of holy triumph,
While they sing the glad" new song."

Far away beyond the shadows
Let us lift our longing eyes,
Where the shining hills of glory
In their strength and beauty rise.

Far away beyond the shadows,
In our Father's house at home,
There our precious ones, departed,
Watch and wait for us to come.


931
Beyond the smiling and the weeping

Beyond the smiling and the weeping,
I shall be soon! I shall be soon!
Beyond the waking and the sleeping,
Beyond the sowing and the reaping,
I shall be soon! I shall be soon!

c
Love, rest, and home!
Sweet, sweet home!
Lord, tarry not! Lord, tarry not, but come!

Beyond the blooming and the fading,
I shall be soon! I shall be soon!
Beyond the shining and the shading,
Beyond the hoping and the dreading,
I shall be soon! I shall be soon!

Beyond the parting and the meeting,
I shall be soon! I shall be soon!
Beyond the farewell and the greeting,
Beyond the pulse's fever-beating,
I shall be soon! I shall be soon!

Beyond the frost-chain and the fever,
I shall be soon! I shall be soon!
Beyond the rock-waste and the river,
Beyond the" ever" and the" never,"
I shall be soon! I shall be soon!


932
Blessed hope that in Jesus is given

Blessed hope that in Jesus is given,
In our sorrow to cheer and sustain,
That soon with our Saviour in heaven,
We shall meet with our loved ones again.

c
Blessed hope! . . . Blessed hope! . . .
We shall meet with our loved ones again!
Blessed hope! . . . Blessed hope! . . .
We shall meet with our loved ones again!

Blessed hope in the word God has spoken,
All our peace by that word we obtain;
And as sure as God's word was ne'er broken,
We shall meet with our loved ones again.

Blessed hope! how it shines in our sorrow,
Like the star over Bethlehem's plain,
That it may be, with Him, ere the morrow,
We shall meet with our loved ones again.

Blessed hope! the bright star of the morning,
That shall herald His coming to reign;
Oh, the glory that waits its fair dawning,
When we meet with our loved ones again.


933
Just beyond the silent river

Just beyond the silent river,
Over on the farther shore,
Many loved ones there shall greet us,
Where the many mansions are.

c
Just beyond earth's snow-capped mountains,
In that land so bright and fair,
We shall see and be like Jesus,
Safe for ever" over there";
We shall see and be like Jesus,
Safe for ever" over there."

Just beyond these fleeting shadows,
Over on the golden strand,
Robed in white, we'll walk with Jesus
Through that fair and happy land.

Just beyond these earthly partings
We shall soon united be,
In the home beyond the river,
Close beside the crystal sea.


934
I hear a song, a song so sweet

I hear a song, a song so sweet,
I try all vainly to repeat
Its melody, and trusting say,
I'll sing it, if God will, some day.

c
Some day, some hap - py day to be, ...
My voice will learn . . its melody, ...
And I shall sing the songs so sweet
Of rest and heaven at Jesus' feet.

Some day my journey will be done,
Earth will be lost and heaven won;
And when the long rough way is trod,
I shall behold my Saviour God.

"Some day, "I say, content to wait
The opening of the jasper gate —
Come soon or late, that day will be
The dawn of endless rest to me.

When comes the time for me to go,
The homeward path I may not know;
But in God's hand my own I'll lay,
And He will lead me home" someday."


935
Oh, for a song, a fair new song

Oh, for a song, a fair new song,
Of praise, and joy, and love!
To reach the hearts of earth's sad throng,
And lift to heaven above—
Of praise like the praise that the angels bring;
Of joy like the joy of the birds:
Of the love in our hearts for the Christ our King —
Love ever too deep for words.

Oh, for a song, a fair new song,
That ne'er was sung before!
To sing to Him to whom belong
Our praises evermore —
A song like the echo from harps above,
Dropped down from the city of gold;
Yea, a song of the joy, and the praise, and love,
That ne'er hath been sung or told.

Oh, who shall sing this fair new song,
Or make its chords complete —
All notes of love, in souls that throng,
And place before His feet.
All fadeless the flowers in His pathway strewn,
The pathway of Jesus our King?
Help us, Lord! for alas, sadly out of tune
Are the hearts which the song would sing.

Oh, help us, Lord! who knowest all!
We cannot sing or speak;
The clearest notes our lips let fall
Seem e'er too cold and weak:
Though sweet are the strains which
our songs have rung
From earth to the city of gold,
Yet His fulness of glory we never have sung—
The half ne'er hath yet been told.

Such songs as angels ne'er can bring,
The joy more pure than birds;
The love we bear for Christ our King -
'Tis far too deep for words.
Be still, heart of mine! we must wait a while,
Thy God will attune thee ere long;
Then in heaven thou shalt sing in the Master's smile
For ever the fair new song!


936
We shall meet beyond the river

We shall meet beyond the river,
By and by, by and by;
And the darkness shall be over,
By and by, by and by;
With the toilsome journey done,
And the glorious battle won,
We shall shine forth as the sun,
By and by, by and by.

We shall strike the harps of glory,
We shall sing redemption's story,
And the strains for evermore
Shall resound in sweetness o'er
Yonder everlasting shore,
By and by, by and by.

We shall see and be like Jesus,
Who a crown of life will give us,
And the angels who fulfil
All the mandates of His will
Shall attend and love us still,
By and by, by and by.

There our tears shall all cease flowing,
And with sweetest rapture knowing,
And all the blest ones, who have gone
To the land of life and song,
We with shoutings shall rejoin,
By and by, by and by.


937
They tell me of a land so fair

They tell me of a land so fair,
Unseen by mortal eyes,
Where spring in fadeless beauty blooms
Beneath unclouded skies.

"Eye... hath not seen, ...ear ... hath not heard,
neither hath it entered into the heart of man,
the things ... which God ... hath prepared for them,
prepared for them ... that love ... Him." ...

They tell me of a land so fair,
Where all is light and song;
Where angel-choirs their anthems join
With yonder blood-washed throng.

No radiant beams from sun or moon
Adorn that land so fair;
For He who sits upon the throne
Shines forth resplendent there!

O land of light and love and joy,
Where comes no night of care,
What will our song of triumph be
When we shall enter there!


938
"Land ahead!" its fruits are waving

"Land ahead!" its fruits are waving
O'er the hills of fadeless green;
And the living waters laving
Shores where heavenly forms are seen.

c
Rocks and storms I'll fear no more,
When on that eternal shore;
Drop the anchor! furl the sail!
I am safe within the vail!

Onward, bark! the cape I'm rounding
See the blessed wave their hands;
Hear the harps of God resounding
From the bright immortal bands.

There" let go the anchor, "riding
On this calm and silvery bay:
Seaward fast the tide is gliding,
Shores in sunlight stretch away.

When we're free from all temptation,
And the storms of life are past;
We'll praise the Rock of our salvation,
Who hath brought us home at last!


939
Soon will come the setting sun

Soon will come the setting sun,
When our work will all be done,
And the weary heart at last be still;
But the Lord of earth and sky
Shall awake us by and by,
And we'll meet again on Zion's hill.

c
We'll meet each other there;
Yes, we'll meet each other there;
And the Saviour's likeness bear,
In that land so bright and fair.
We'll meet each other there;
Yes, we'll meet each other there,
And His glo---ry we shall share.

Deep the shadows in the vale,
Fierce the howling of the gale,
Long and dark the storm around our door;
But the Lord will guide the way
To the shining realms of day,
Where the storms of earth shall come no more.

Though our eyes be filled with tears,
And our hearts with many fears,
And the days of earth be filled with care;
Yet the Lord at length will come,
In His love to take us home,
And we'll never know a sorrow there.


940
There is an hour of peaceful rest

There is an hour of peaceful rest,
To mourning wanderers given;
There is a joy for souls distrest,
A balm for every wounded breast;
'Tis found above—in heaven.

There is a home for weary souls
By sin and sorrow driven —
When tossed on life's tempestuous shoals,
Where storms arise and ocean rolls,
And all is drear—but heaven.

There faith lifts up her cheerful eye
To brighten prospects given;
And views the tempests passing by,
The evening shadows quickly fly,
And all serene—in heaven.

There fragrant flowers immortal bloom,
And joys supreme are given;
There rays divine disperse the gloom;
Beyond the confines of the tomb
Appears the dawn—of heaven!


941
There is a land beyond the stars

There is a land beyond the stars,
Glory Land, bright Glory Land!
Beyond the sunset's crimson bars,
Glory Land, bright Glory Land!
A land of peace without alloy;
Of joy beyond all earthly joy;
And naught its calm can e'er destroy,
Glory Land, bright Glory Land!

The city of our God is there,
Its jasper walls with beauty fair,
Its gates of pearl like silver gleam,
Its skies with fadeless sunlight beam,
And through it rolls life's crystal stream,
Glory Land, bright Glory Land!

We lift our eyes by faith, and see
Where Christ Himself the light shall be,
There songs of praise glad hearts shall sing;
The radiant air with music ring;
Each voice proclaim our Saviour King,
Glory Land, bright Glory Land!


942
Oh, think of the Home over there

Oh, think of the Home over there,
By the side of the river of light, . . .
Where the saints, all immortal and fair,
Are robed in their garments of white. . . .

c
Over there, . . . over there; . . .
Oh, think of the Home over there! . . .
Over there, . . . over there, over there;
Oh, think of the Home over there!

Oh, think of the friends over there,
Who before us the journey have trod;. . .
Of the songs that they breathe on the air,
In their home in the palace of God. . . .

c
Over there, . . . over there; . . .
Oh, think of the friends over there! . . .

My Saviour is now over there,
There my kindred and friends are at rest; . . .
Then, away from my sorrow and care,
Let me fly to the land ofthe blest. . .

c
Over there, . . . over there; . . .
My Saviour is now over there! . . .

I'll soon be at home over there,
For the end of my journey I see; . . .
Many dear to my heart over there
Are watching and waiting for me.

c
Over there, . . . over there; . . .
I'll soon be at home over there! . . .

What will it matter by and by

What will it matter by and by,
What will it matter by and by,
Whether my crosses were heavy or light,
Whether my pathway was clouded or bright,
When I shall walk with the ransomed in white,
Safe in that beautiful land?

What will it matter by and by,
Whether my trials were many or few,
Whether the world was unfaithful or
true,
When my Redeemer in glory I view,
Safe in that beautiful land?

What will it matter by and by,
Whether the waters were bitter or sweet,
Murmuring gently or sat at my feet,
When the departed with rapture I meet,
Safe in that beautiful land?

What will it matter by and by,
Whether I pass with the morning away,
Whether at noontide or closing of day,
When in the valley of Eden I stray,
Safe in that beautiful land?


944
I've reached the land of corn and wine

I've reached the land of corn and wine,
And all its riches freely mine;
Here shines undimmed one blissful day,
For all my night has passed away.

c
O Beulah Land, sweet Beulah Land,
As on thy highest mount I stand,
 Ilook away across the sea,
Where_ mansions are prepared for me,
And view the shining glory shore:
My heaven, my home for evermore!

My Saviour comes and walks with me,
And sweet communion here have we;
He gently leads me by His hand,
For this is heaven's borderland.

A sweet perfume upon the breeze
Is borne from ever-vernal trees;
And flowers that, never fading, grow
Where streams of life for ever flow.

The zephyrs seem to float to me
Sweet sounds of heaven's melody,
As angels with the white-robed throng
Join in the sweet redemption song.

945
When the mists have rolled in splendour

When the mists have rolled in splendour
From the beauty of the hills,
And the sunlight falls in gladness
On the river and the rills,
We recall our Father's promise
In the rainbow of the spray:
We shall know each other better
When the mists have rolled away.

c
We shall know ... as we are known, . . .
Nevermore ... to walk alone, . . .
In the dawning of the morning
Of that bright and happy day:
We shall know each other better,
When the mists have rolled away!

Oft we tread the path before us
With a weary, burdened heart;
Oft we toil amid the shadows,
And our fields are far apart:
But the Saviour's"Come, ye blessed!"
All our labour will repay,
When we gather in the morning
Where the mists have rolled away.

We shall come with joy and gladness,
We shall gather round the throne:
Face to face with those that love us,
We shall know as we are known:
And the song of our redemption
Shall resound through endless day,
When the shadows have departed,
And the mists have rolled away.


946
My Father is rich in houses and lands

My Father is rich in houses and lands,
He holdeth the wealth of the world in His hands!
Of rubies and diamonds, of silver and gold,
His coffers are full — He has riches untold.

c
I'm the child of a King! the child of a King!
With Jesus my Saviour, I'm the child of a King!

My Father's own Son, the Saviour of men,
Once wandered o'er earth as the poorest of them;
But now He is reigning for ever on high,
And will give me a home in heaven by and by.

I once was an outcast stranger on earth,
A sinner by choice, an alien by birth!
But I've been adopted, my name's written down —
An heir to a mansion, a robe, and a crown!

A tent or a cottage, why should I care?
They're building a palace for me over there!
Though exiled from home, yet still I may sing:
All glory to God, I'm the child of a King!

947
Only" a little while" sowing and reaping,

Only" a little while" sowing and reaping,
Only" a little while" our vigil keeping;
Then shall we gather home, no more to sever,
Clasped in eternal love, blest, blest for ever!

c
Blest, blest for ever! no more to sever:
Clasped in eternal love, blest, blest for ever!

Only" a little while" heart-break and sorrow,
Dark though the night may be, cloud less the morrow;
Only" a little while, "earth-ties to sever,
Then in our Fatherland, blest, blest for ever!

Only" a little while" shadow and sadness,
Then in eternity, sunshine and gladness;
Only" a little while, "then o'er the river,
Home, rest, and victor-palm, life, joy, for ever!


948
Speeding away o'er the river of time

Speeding away o'er the river of time,
Where the sweet bells of eternity chime;
Speeding away to the Eden above,
Filled with the fulness of rapture and love.

c
Beautiful land, . . beautiful land,
In thy green pastures the weary shall rest:
Beautiful land, . . beautiful land,
Home of the glorified, home of the blest.

Speeding away to the valley of song,
Speeding away to a glorified throng;
Sweeping the chords of their harps while they sing,
Glory to Jesus our Saviour and King.

Speeding away to be severed no more,
Speeding away to the evergreen shore;
There in the garments of beauty arrayed,
Flowers are blooming that never shall fade.

Speeding away, we are speeding away,
On to the region of infinite day;
Only a veil to be lifted, and then,
Oh, what a meeting with dear ones again!


949
When all my labours and trials are o'er,

When all my labours and trials are o'er,
And I am safe on that beautiful shore,
Just to be near the dear Lord I adore,
Will through the ages be glory for me.

c
Oh, that will be . . glory for me, . . .
Glory for me, . . glory for me, . .
When by His grace I shall look on His face,
That will be glory, be glory for me!

When by the gift of His infinite grace
I am accorded in heaven a place,
Just to be there, and to look on His face,
Will through the ages be glory for me.

Friends will be there I have loved long ago;
Joy like a river around me will flow;
Yet, just a smile from my Saviour, I know,
Will through the ages be glory for me.


950
There is a calm, beyond life's fitful fever

There is a calm, beyond life's fitful fever,
A deep repose, an everlasting rest;
Where white-robed angels welcome the believer
Among the blest, among the blest.
There is a Home, where all the soul's deep yearnings
And silent prayers shall be at last fulfilled;
Where strife and sorrow, murmurings and heart-burnings,
At last are stilled, at last are stilled.

There is a Hope, to which the Christian, clinging,
Is lifted high above life's surging wave;
Finds life in death, and fadeless flowers springing
From the dark grave, from the dark grave.
There is a Crown, prepared for those who love Him;
The Christian sees it in the distance shine.
Like a bright beacon glittering above him
And whispers,"Mine!" and whispers,"Mine!"

There is a spotless Robe of Christ'.? own weaving:
Wilt thou not wrap it round thy sin-stained soul?
Poor wandering child, upon thy past life grieving,
Christ makes thee whole! Christ makes thee whole!
There is a Home, a Harp, a Crown in heaven —
O God! that any should Thy gift refuse!
The awful choice of life and death is given —
Which wilt thou choose? which wilt thou choose?


951
Still, still with Thee, when purple morning breaketh

Still, still with Thee, when purple morning breaketh,
When the bird waketh, and the shadows flee;
Fairer than morning, lovelier than daylight,
Dawns the sweet consciousness, I am with Thee.

Alone with Thee, amid the mystic shadows,
The solemn hush of nature newly born;
Alone with Thee in breathless adoration,
In the calm dew and freshness of the morn.

As in the dawning, o'er the waveless ocean,
The image of the morning-star doth rest;
So, in this stillness Thou beholdest only
Thine image in the waters of my breast.

Still, still with Thee! as to each new- born morning
A fresh and solemn splendour still is given;
So does this blessed consciousness awaking
Breathe each day nearness unto Thee and heaven.

When sinks the soul, subdued by toil, to slumber,
Its closing eye looks up to Thee in prayer;
Sweet the repose beneath Thy wings o'er-shading,
But sweeter still, to wake and find Thee there.

So shall it be at last, in that bright morning
When the soul waketh, and life's shadows flee;
Oh, in that hour, fairer than daylight dawning,
Shall rise the glorious thought — I am with Thee!


952
A little while, and we shall be

A little while, and we shall be
Where sin shall never dwell;
A little while, and we shall live
Where songs of triumph swell.

c
A little while, . . and we shall see . .
Our Sa - - viour face to face, . .
And we shall sing . . through endless years . .
The won - - ders of His grace. . .

A little while, and we shall stand
Amid the blood-washed throng;
A little while, and we shall sing
The everlasting song.

A little while, and we shall meet
The loved ones gone before;
And we shall clasp their hands again
On yonder radiant shore.

A little while, and we shall hear
The Saviour's whisper, "Come!"
And we shall ever dwell with Him
In our eternal home.


953
Some day, but when I cannot tell

Some day, but when I cannot tell,
To toil and tears I'll bid farewell;
For I shall with the angels dwell,
Some day, some blessed day.

c
Some day, . . . some day, . . .
I'll be at home with Christ to stay,
Some day, some blessed day.

Some day within the gates so fair,
A golden harp my hands shall bear;
And glistening robes of white I'll wear,
Some day, some blessed day.

Some day I'll see my Saviour's face,
And, welcomed to His blest embrace,
Shall with His people find a place,
Some day, some blessed day.

Some day, some blessed day, I know
I'll find the loved of long ago,
And learn how much to Christ I owe,
Some day, some blessed day.


954
Beyond the stars that brightly gleam

Beyond the stars that brightly gleam,
Beyond life's short and shadowed stream,
There is a land of fadeless bloom,
And flowers of rich and rare perfume:
Perfect peace we there shall know,
Like the river's endless flow.

c
Beyond the stars . . sweet peace we'll know,.
Calm as the crys - - tal river's flow: . .
Where rolls the sea . . of perfect love, . .
Beyond the stars . . that gleam above.

Beyond the stars no storm will beat,
No thorns will pierce our weary feet,
No sad good-byes we e'er shall say,
And see fond faces glide away:
Forms that here we seek in vain,
There we'll clasp their hands again.

Beyond the stars no toils or tears,
No sombre skies or gloomy fears;
For He who trod life's weary way
Shall wipe all sorrow's tears away:
Endless joys shall then be mine,
When I see His face divine.


955
O'er the cold and chilly blast

O'er the cold and chilly blast,
By and by, by and by!
We shall gather home at last,
By and by, by and by!
Far beyond the stormy gale,
Anchored safe within the vail,
We shall furl our shattered sail,
By and by, by and by!

We shall see our Saviour's face
By and by, by and by!
We shall sing redeeming grace,
By and by, by and by!
Where the rose and lily grow,
Where our tears shall cease to flow,
Oh, the joy that we shall know
By and by, by and by!

In the golden fields above,
By and by, by and by!
We shall meet the friends we love,
By and by, by and by!
On that pure and fragrant shore
All our trials will be o'er,
We shall say farewell no more
By and by, by and by!


956
After the mist and shadow, after the dreary night

After the mist and shadow, after the dreary night,
After the sleepless watching, cometh the morning light;
Beautiful, soft, and tender, leading the soul along,
Over the silent river, into the land of song.

After the thorny pathway, after the storms we meet,
After the heart's deep longing, joy and communion sweet;
After the weary conflict, rest in the Saviour's love,
Over the silent river, safe in the home above.

After the cares and trials, after the toils and tears,
After the time of sowing, reaping thro' endless years;
After the pilgrim journey, rapture that ne'er shall cease,
Over the silent river, rest in the land of peace.


957
Beyond the light of setting suns

Beyond the light of setting suns,
Beyond the clouded sky,
Beyond where starlight fades in night —
I have a home on high.

c
A mansion there, . . . not made with hands, . . .
A place . . prepared for me; . . .
And while God lives, and angels sing, . . .
That home . . my home shall be. . . .

Beyond all pain, beyond all care,
Beyond life's mystery,
Beyond the range of time and change —
My home's reserved for me.

Beyond where death's dark billows
Beyond these scenes of night,
I look, while gladness fills my soul, roll,
To yonder home of light.

My sins and sorrows, strifes and fears,
I bid them all farewell,
High up amid the eternal years,
With Christ, my Lord, to dwell.


958
Sometimes I hear strange music

Sometimes I hear strange music,
Like none e'er heard before,
Come floating softly earthward
As through heaven's open door:
It seems like angel voices,
In strains of joy and love,
That swell the mighty chorus
Around the throne above.

c
O sweet, unearthly music,
Heard from a land afar —
The song of Heaven and Homeland,
Through doors God leaves ajar!

Now soft, and low, and restful,
It floods my soul with peace,
As if God's benediction
Bade all earth's troubles cease.
Then grander than the voices
Of wind, and wave, and sea —
It fills the dome of heaven
With glorious harmony.

This music haunts me ever,
Like something heard in dreams —
It seems to catch the cadence
Of heavenly winds and streams.
My heart is filled with rapture,
To think, some day to come,
I'll sing it with the angels —
The song of heaven and home.


959
Only a look from my Saviour

Only a look from my Saviour,
Only a clasp of His hand,
Only to watch for His coming,
Only to wait His command;
Only to follow Him ever,
Aiding the poor and opprest—
Then, when the labour is ended,
Shall come quiet rest.

Only a look from my Saviour,
When I am laden with care,
Only a message of mercy,
Whispered in answer to prayer.
Only to gather the weary
Into the fold of the blest —
Then, when the labour is ended,
Shall come quiet rest.

Only a look from my Saviour,
Only to trust in His love,
While He is drawing me nearer
Home to His kingdom above;
Only to work for His glory,
Faithfully doing my best,
Then, when the labour is ended,
Shall come quiet rest.


960
Sitting by the gateway of a palace fair

Sitting by the gateway of a palace fair,
Once a child of God was left to die;
By the world neglected, wealth would nothing share:
See the change awaiting there on high.

c
Carried by the angels to the land of rest,
Music sweetly sounding through the skies;
Welcomed by the Saviour to the heavenly feast,
Gathered with the loved in Paradise.

What shall be the ending of this life of care?
Oft the question cometh to us all;
Here upon the pathway hard the burdens bear,
And the burning tears of sorrow fall.

Follower of Jesus, scanty though thy store,
Treasures, precious treasures, wait on high;
Count the trials joyful, soon they'll all be o'er:
Oh, the change that's coming by and by!

Upward then, and onward! —onward for the Lord!
Time and talent all in His employ;
Small may seem the service—sure the great reward:
Here the cross—but there the crown of joy!


961
With friends on earth we meet in gladness

With friends on earth we meet in gladness,
While swift the moments fly,
Yet ever comes the thought of sadness,
That we must say" Good-bye."

c
We'll never say" Good-bye" in heaven.
We'll never say" Good-bye"; . .
In that fair land of joy and song,
We'll never say" Good-bye."

How joyful is the hope that lingers,
When loved ones cross death's sea,
That we, when all earth's toils are ended,
With them shall ever be.

No parting words shall e'er be spoken
In yonder home so fair;
But songs ofjoy, and peace, and gladness.
We'll sing for ever there.


962
Will you meet me at the fountain

Will you meet me at the fountain,
When I reach the glory-land?
Will you meet me at the fountain?
Shall I clasp your friendly hand?
Other friends will give me welcome,
Other loving voices cheer:
There'll be music at the fountain --
Will you, will you meet me there?

c
Yes, I'll meet you at the fountain,
At the fountain bright and fair, . . .
Oh, I'll meet you at the fountain,
Yes, I'll meet you, meet you there.

Will you meet me at the fountain?
For I'm sure that I shall know
Kindred souls and sweet communion,
More than I have known below;
And the chorus will be sweeter,
When it bursts upon my ear,
And my heaven seem completer,
If your happy voice I hear.

Will you meet me at the fountain?
I shall long to have you near,
When I meet my loving Saviour,
When His welcome words I hear.
He will meet me at the fountain,
His embraces I shall share:
There'll be glory at the fountain —
Will you, will you meet me there?


963
There may be stormy days

There may be stormy days,
There may be hours of care:
I'll welcome all—they beckon me
Where God and the angels are

c
Where God and the angels are, . .
In yon bright world afar; . .
Oh, blessed hour when I shall dwell
Where God and the angels are!

The Lord is all my strength
And ever-guiding Star,
To lead me safely to that land
Where God and the angels are.

My mansion is secure
In yonder realms afar:
My crown is there, laid up for me,
Where God and the angels are.

My bark is homeward bound;
I soon shall cross the bar,
And safely anchor, home at last,
Where God and the angels are.


964
There's a land that is fairer than day

There's a land that is fairer than day,
And by faith we can see it afar,
For the Father waits over the way,
To prepare us a dwelling-place there.

c
In the sweet . . . by-and-by, . . .
We shall meet on that beautiful shore; . . .
In the sweet . . . by-and-by, . . .
We shall meet on that beautiful shore.

We shall sing on that beautiful shore
The melodious songs of the blest;
And our spirits shall sorrow no more —
Not a sigh for the blessing of rest.

To our bountiful Father above
We will offer the tribute of praise,
For the glorious gift of His love,
And the blessings that hallow our days.


965
When our ships have crossed the ocean

When our ships have crossed the ocean,
and been all around the world,
When they safely gain the haven, and
their sails again are furled;
We rejoice to see them enter, and to
know the anchor's cast,
Raising joyful shouts of welcome, for
our ships are home at last.

c
Oh what singing, oh what shouting, when our
ships come sailing home!
They have stood the mighty tempests, they
have crossed the ocean's foam;
They have passed o'er stormy billows,
but they now have gained the shore:
The anchor's cast, they're home at last,
the voyage is safely o'er.

But if there is such rejoicing to see
vessels here get home,
When we know that in a little while
these ships again will roam —
Oh, what must it be in heaven when
a soul comes sailing in,
To go out no more for ever sailing on
the sea of f sin?

Oh, methinks I hear the angels shout,
"Here comes an earthly bark,
She has found her way to heaven, tho'
the way was rough and dark:
But she had a star to guide her called
the Bright and Morning Star,
It has guided millions over from that
distant land afar."

So with Jesus as our Captain we ex-
pect to gain that shore;
We expect to cast our anchor there,
and stay for evermore;
And we know the angels will be there
to greet us when we come,
They will join in songs of rapture,
Welcome home, oh, welcome home!"


966
We shall stand before the King

We shall stand before the King,
With the angels we shall sing,
By and by, . . . by and by! . . .
Walk the bright, the golden shore,
Praising Him for evermore,
By and by, . . . by and by! . . .

c
We shall stand . . . before the King, . . .
With the angels we shall sing:
Glory, glory to our King!
Hallelujah! hallelu - - jah!
We shall stand . . . before the King.

Ring, ye bells of heaven, ring!
We shall stand before the King,
By and by, . . . by and by! . . .
There our sorrows will be o'er;
There His name we will adore,
By and by, . . . by and by! . . .

Wake, my soul! thy tribute bring;
Thou shalt stand before the King,
By and by, . . . by and by! . . .
Lay thy trophies at His feet;
In His likeness stand complete,
By and by, . . . by and by! . .


967
When my life-work is ended, and I cross the swelling tide

When my life-work is ended, and I cross the swelling tide,
When the bright and glorious morning I shall see;
I shall know my Redeemer when I reach the other side,
And His smile will be the first to welcome me.

c
I shall know . . . Him, I shall know Him,
When redeemed by His side I shall stand;
I shall know . . . Him, I shall know Him
By the print of the nails in His hand.

Oh, the soul-thrilling rapture when I view His blessed face,
And the lustre of His kindly beaming eye;
How my full heart will praise Him for the mercy, love, and grace,
That prepare for me a mansion in the sky.

Oh, the dear ones in glory, how they beckon me to come,
And our parting at the river I recall;
To the sweet vales of Eden they will sing my welcome home:
But I long to meet my Saviour first of all.

Through the gates of the city, in a robe of spotless white,
He will lead me where no tears will ever fall;
In the glad song of ages I shall mingle with delight:
But I long to meet my Saviour first of all.


968
By and by we shall know Jesus

By and by we shall know Jesus,
By and by, oh, by and by;
Even now He looks and sees us,
Journeying toward His Home on high,
And He smiles upon us, saying,
By and by, oh, by and by,
Cares and trials you'll be laying
With your earthly garments by."

c
Oh, "By and by, "we sing it softly,
Thinking not of earthly care,
But the" by and by" of heaven
Waiting for us over there.

By and by we shall be standing,
By and by, oh, by and by,
At fair heaven's shining landing,
While the river murmurs by;
And our friends will round us gather,
By and by, oh, by and by,
Saying, Welcome, for the Father
Loves to have His children nigh."

By and by!" we say it gently,
Looking on our peaceful dead,
And we do not think of earth-life,
But of heaven's sweet life instead.
By and by we all shall gather,
By and by, oh, by and by,
In the love of God our Father,
That shall know no" by and by."


969
'Tis a goodly pleasant land that we pilgrims journey through

'Tis a goodly pleasant land that we pilgrims journey through,
And our Father's constant blessings fall around us like the dew;
But its sunshine and its beauty to our hearts no joy can bring,
Like the splendours that await us in the palace of the King

c
Oh, the palace of the King! royal palace of the King!
Where our Father in His mercy all the ransomed ones will bring;
Where our sorrows and our trials like a dream will pass away,
And our souls shall dwell for ever in the realms of endless day.

Our Redeemer is the King; what a sacrifice He made,
When He purchased our redemption, and His blood the ransom paid!
In His cross shall be our glory; to that blessed cross we'll cling,
Till we reach the gates that open to the palace of the King.

In this goodly pleasant land only strangers now are we,
For we seek a better country, and 'tis there we long to be;
Yes, we long to swell the anthem that for evermore shall ring,
From the pure in heart made perfect, in the palace of the King.

We shall see Him by and by; Hallelujah to His name!
Through the blood of His atonement life eternal we may claim;
We shall cast our crowns before Him, and our songs of victory sing,
When we enter in triumphant to the palace of the King.


970
No longer we'll wander in darkness and night

No longer we'll wander in darkness and night,
When the beautiful gates unfold;
We'll walk in that city where God is the light,
When the beautiful gates unfold.

c
When the beautiful gates unfold, . .
When the beautiful gates unfold; . .
There happy we'll be, for the Lord we shall see,
When the beautiful gates unfold.

My loved ones will wait at the harbour for me,
To welcome me home, where from sin I'll be free,

No sickness, no sorrow, no pain as before,
With joy we'll commune with our friends as of yore,

A rapture unspeakable then shall be mine,
As there I behold Him so pure and divine,

A halo of glory will shadow us o'er,
With joy we will sing on that far- away shore,

The burden oflife will no longer annoy,
With Christ we will live in perpetual joy.


971
Far, far beyond the storms that

Far, far beyond the storms that
Dark o'er our way,
There shines the light of joy eternal gather
Bright in the realms of day.

c
There shall sorrow, pain, and parting,
Grieve our hearts no more;
Soon, soon we'll meet beyond the river,
Safe on the Home-land shore.

Far, far beyond the rolling billows
Faith spreads her wings;
Love tells us of the golden City,
Hope of its glory sings.

Far, far beyond the vale and shadow
Loved ones have passed;
We'll meet them in the" many mansions,"
All gathered home at last.

O blessed morn of joy unbounded!
O glorious day!
There every tear of grief and anguish
Jesus shall wipe away.


972
There is a land that lies afar

There is a land that lies afar
Where grief is all unknown;
A land wherein the angels sing
Around the heavenly throne.

Oh, 'twill be sweet when we shall meet
Upon that distant shore,
Whereon the glorious sun ne'er sets,
But shines for evermore, But shines for evermore.

We are but pilgrims on the earth,
And brief our sojourn here;
But well we know beyond this vale
There is a brighter sphere.

There is a realm of boundless love,
A goal for hearts distrest,
Where all may find for endless years
A home among the blest.


973
On Jordan's stormy banks I stand

On Jordan's stormy banks I stand,
And cast a wistful eye
To Canaan's fair and happy land,
Where my possessions lie.

c
We will rest in the fair and happy land, . . .
Just across on the evergreen shore, . . .
Sing the song of Moses and the Lamb, by and by,
And dwell with Jesus evermore.

O'er all those wide extended plains
Shines one eternal day;
There God the Son for ever reigns,
And scatters night away.

When shall I reach that happy place.
And be for ever blest?
When shall I see my Father's face,
And in His bosom rest?

Filled with delight, my raptured soul roll,
Would here no longer stay:
Though Jordan's waves around me
Fearless I'd launch away


974
Oh, blessed home where those who meet

Oh, blessed home where those who meet
Shall never say good-bye;
Where kindred souls each other greet,
And never say good-bye.

c
We'll never say good-bye; . .
We'll never say good-bye; . .
In that fair land beyond the sky,
We'll never say good-bye.

Beyond this vale of toil and care
We'll never say good-bye;
We part in tears on earth, but there —
We'll never say good-bye.

When safe among the ransomed throng,
We'll never say good-bye;
Where life is one eternal song,
We'll never say good-bye.

On yonder fair and peaceful shore,
We'll never say good-bye;
But dwell with Christ for evermore,
And never say good-bye.

The sands of time are sinking

The sands of time are sinking,
The dawn of heaven breaks,
The summer morn I've sighed for —
The fair, sweet morn awakes.
Dark, dark hath been the midnight,
But dayspring is at hand,
And glory, glory dwelleth
In Immanuel's land.

Oh, Christ He is the fountain,
The deep, sweet well of love!
The streams on earth I've tasted,
More deep I'll drink above:
There, to an ocean fulness,
His mercy doth expand;
And glory, glory dwelleth
In Immanuel's land.

The bride eyes not her garment,
But her dear bridegroom's face;
I will not gaze at glory,
But on my King of grace,—
Not at the crown He giveth,
But on His pierced hand.
The Lamb is all the glory
Of Immanuel's land.

With mercy and with judgment
My web of time He wove,
And aye the dews of sorrow
Were lustred by His love.
I'll bless the hand that guided,
I'll bless the heart that planned,
When throned where glory dwelleth,
In Immanuel's land.


976
My heart's in the Home-land, far, far o'er the tide,

My heart's in the Home-land, far, far o'er the tide,
Where those who are faithful shall ever abide;
My heart's in the Home-land, that region so fair,
Where loved ones are waiting to welcome me there.

c
My heart's ... in the Home-land,
That region, that region so fair; . . .
My heart's ... in the Home-land, . . .
My Saviour, my Saviour is there. . .

My heart's in the Home-land, and why should I fear?
When labour is ended, a voice I shall hear,
That calls to a mansion where love never dies,
To yonder fair region beyond the blue skies.

My heart's in the Home-land, its valleys and hills,
Its sunshine with gladness my whole being thrills;
I know some glad morning my spirit will soar
Away to the Home-land, and rest evermore.


977
The weary hours like shadows come and go

The weary hours like shadows come and go,
As still I strive, by earnest faith and prayer,
To do each day the duties that I know,
And bear the cross my Saviour bids me bear.

But are there many weary miles to tread
Before the promised home appears in sight?
And are there sad and bitter tears to shed
Ere we shall meet in realms of endless light?

Some little joy I have in doing still
The humble work He bids me do for Him;
A tender gladness when 'tis mine to fill
Again some empty chalice to the brim.

And thus the days are slowly passing here
With distant gleams of hope and glory blest;
But is the hallowed moment drawing near
When we shall meet again in endless rest?

Ah, yes, when that great light which men call Death
Strikes through the gloom and stills at last the strife,
Then comes a hush, a sigh, a fleeting breath,
And we shall meet again in endless life.


978
Some day the silver cord will break

Some day the silver cord will break,
And I no more as now shall sing;
But oh, the joy when I shall wake
Within the palace of the King!

c
And I shall see . . Him face to face, . .
And tell the story—Saved by grace;
And I shall see . . Him face to face, . .
And tell the story—Saved by grace.

Some day my earthly house will fall,
I cannot tell how soon 'twill be;
But this I know—my All in All
Has now a place in heaven for me.

Some day, when fades the golden sun
Beneath the rosy-tinted west,
My blessed Lord shall say, "Well done!"
And I shall enter into rest,

Some day; till then I'll watch and wait —
My lamp all trimmed and burning bright —
That when my Saviour opes the gate,
My soul to Him may take its flight.


979
Oh, the music rolling onward

Oh, the music rolling onward,
Thro' the boundless regions bright,
Where the King in all His beauty
Is the glory and the light!
Where the sunshine of His presence
Every wave of sorrow stills,
And the bells of joy are ringing
On the everlasting hills.

Oh, the music rolling onward
Like a mighty ocean tide —
Oft I seem to hear its echoes,
While to earth they softly glide!
And there comes to me a vision,
That my soul with rapture thrills,
For I stand by faith uplifted
On the everlasting hills.

When I wake amid the splendour
That I see but dimly now,
And behold the crown of jewels
That adorns my Saviour's brow,
Where eternal spring abideth.
And the sky no darkness fills —
How my grateful heart shall praise Him
On the everlasting hills.


980
I know not the hour when my Lord will come

I know not the hour when my Lord will come
To take me away to His own dear home;

But I know that His presence will lighten the gloom,
And that will be glory for me.

c
And that will be glory for me; . . .
Oh, that will be glory for me;
But I know that His presence will lighten the gloom,
And that will be glory for me.

I know not the song that the angels sing,
I know not the sound of the harps' glad ring;
But I know there'll be mention of Jesus our King,
And that will be music for me.

And that will be music for me, etc.

I know not the form of my mansion fair,
I know not the name that I then shall bear;
But I know that my Saviour will welcome me there,
And that will be heaven for me.

And that will be heaven for me, etc.


981
There is a land mine eye hath seen

There is a land mine eye hath seen,
In visions of enraptured thought,
So bright that all which spreads between
Is with its radiant glories fraught.

c
O land of love, ... of joy and light, . . .
Thy glories gild . . . earth's darkest night;.
Thy tranquil shore ... we too shall see, ...
When day shall break . . . and shadows flee.

A land upon whose blissful shore
There rests no shadow, falls no stain;
There those who meet shall part no more,
And those long parted meet again.

Its skies are not like earthly skies,
With varying hues of shade and light;
It hath no need of suns, to rise
To dissipate the gloom of night.

There sweeps no desolating wind
Across the calm, serene abode:
The wanderer there a home may find
Within the paradise of God.


982
I am far frae my hame

I am far frae my hame,
An' I'm weary aftenwhiles,
For the langed-for hame-bringin',
An' my Father's welcome smiles;
An' I'll ne'er be fu' content
Until my een do see
The gowden gates o' heaven,
An' my ain countrie.
The earth is flecked wi' flooers,
Mony-tinted, fresh, and gay:
The birdies warble blithely,
For my Father made them
But these sichts an' these soun's
Will as naething be to me,
When I hear the angels singin'
In my ain countrie.

I've His gude word o' promise,
That, some gladsome day, the King
To His ain royal palace
His banished name will bring:
Wi' een an' wi' hert
Rinnin' owre, we shall see
"The King in His beauty,"
In oor ain countrie.
My sins hae been mony,
An' my sorrows hae been sair,
But there they'll never vex me,
Nor be remembered mair;
For His bluid hath made me white,
An' His nan' shall dry my e'e,
When He brings me hame at last
To my ain countrie.

Sae little noo I ken
O' yon blessed, bonnie place —
I only ken it's hame,
Whaur we shall see His face;
It wad surely be eneuch
For evermair to be
I' the glory o' His presence
In oor ain countrie.
Like a bairn to its mither,
A wee birdie to its nest,
I wad fain be gangin' noo
Unto my Saviour's breast;
For He gathers in His bosom
Witless, worthless lambs like me,
An" carries them Himsel'
To His ain countrie.

He is faithfu' that hath promised,
An' He'll surely come again,
He'll keep His tryst wi' me —
At what hour I dinna ken;
But He bids me still to wait,
An' ready aye to be
To gang at ony moment
To my ain countrie.
Sae I'm watchin' aye, an' singin'
O' my hame as I wait
For the soun'in' o' His futfa'
This side the gowden gate:
God gie His grace to ilka ane
Wha listens noo to me,
That we a' may gang in gladness
To oor ain countrie.

When the trumpet of the Lord shall sound

When the trumpet of the Lord shall sound,
and time shall be no more,
And the morning breaks, eternal, bright, and fair;

When the saved of earth shall gather
over on the other shore,
And the roll is called up yonder, I'll be there.

c
When the roil ... is called up yon - - - der,
When the roll ... is called up yon - - - der,
When the roll ... is called up yonder,
When the roll is called up yonder, I'll be there.

On that bright and cloudless morning,
when the dead in Christ shall rise,
And the glory of His resurrection share;
When His chosen ones shall gather to
their home beyond the skies,
And the roll is called up yonder, I'll be there.

Let me labour for the Master from
the dawn till setting sun,
Let me talk of all His wondrous love and care;
Then, when all of life is over, and my
work on earth is done,
And the roll is called up yonder, I'll be there


984
There is a land, a sunny land

There is a land, a sunny land,
Whose skies are ever bright,
Where evening shadows never fall;
The Saviour is its light.

c
If the cross . . we meekly bear, .
Then the crown . . we shall wear, . .
When we dwell . . among the fair, . .
In the bright for-evermore.

There is a clime, a peaceful clime,
Beyond life's narrow sea,
Where every storm is hushed to rest:
There let our treasure be.

There is a home, a glorious home.
A heavenly mansion fair;
And those we loved so fondly here
Will bid us welcome there.

We long to leave these fading scenes
That glide so quickly by,
And join the shining host above,
Where joy can never die.


985
Beyond the sea, . . . life's boundless sea

Beyond the sea, . . . life's boundless sea, . . .
The stormy winds ... are bearing me; . . .
Though fierce and wild ... the surges roar, . . .
They'll bear me all . . . the sooner o'er. . . .

c
Beyond the sea, the boundless sea,
My Saviour's hand is leading me;
Whate'er of ill or pain I bear,
His tender love is with me there.

Above the clouds . . . and storms of life, . . .
Above its care, . . . its toil and strife, . . .
My Saviour's cross . . . I see afar, . . .
My beacon light,. . . my guiding Star. . . .

Beyond the sea, . . . the raging sea, . . .
There is a home . . . reserved for me; . . .
The light that gems . . . my Saviour's brow . . .
With glory gilds . . . my pathway now. . . .

Across the sea, . . . the restless sea, . . .
My onward course . . . shall brighter be, . . .
Though ocean waves . . . may loudly roar, . . .
They'll bear me all . . . the sooner o'er. . . .

Out on the ocean all boundless we ride

Out on the ocean all boundless we ride,
We're homeward bound;
Tossed on the waves of a rough, restless tide,
We're homeward bound;
Far from the safe, quiet harbour of God!
Far from our Father's celestial abode,
Promise of which on us each He's bestowed,
We're homeward bound.


Wildly the storm sweeps us on as it roars,
We're homeward bound;
Look! yonder he the bright, heavenly shores,
We're homeward bound,
Steady, O pilot, stand firm at the wheel!
Steady! we soon shall outweather the gale!
Oh, how we fly 'neath the loud creaking sail!
We're homeward bound.

Into the harbour of heaven now we glide,
We're home at last!
Softly we drift on its bright silver tide,
We're home at last!
Glory to God! all our dangers are o'er,
Safely we stand on the radiant shore;
Glory to God! we will shout ever more,
We're home at last!

One sweetly solemn thought

One sweetly solemn thought
Comes to me o'er and o'er -
I'm nearer home to-day, to-day,
Than e'er I've been before.

c
Nearer my home, nearer my home,
Nearer my home to-day, to-day,
Than e'er I've been before.

Nearer my Father's house,
Where many mansions be;
Nearer the great white throne to-day.
Nearer the crystal sea.

Nearer the bound of life,
Where burdens are laid down;
Nearer leaving the cross to-day,
Nearer gaining the crown.

Be near me when rny feet
Are slipping o'er the brink;
For I am nearer home to-day,
Nearer now than I think.


988
Over the river they call me

Over the river they call me,
Friends that are dear to my heart;
Soon shall I meet them in glory,
Never, no, never to part.

c
Over the river to Eden,
Home to the mansions so fair
Angels will carry me safely,
Jesus will welcome me there.

Over the river they call me;
Hark! 'tis their voices I hear
Borne on the wings of the twilight,
Murmuring softly and clear.

Over the river they call me,
There, is no sorrow nor night;
There they are walking with Jesus,
Clothed in their garments of white.

Over the river they call me,
Watching with bright, beaming eyes;
"Over the river I'm coming,"
Gladly my spirit replies.


989
There is a Paradise of rest

There is a Paradise of rest,
On yonder tranquil shore;
Beyond the shadow and the gloom of night,
Where toil and tears are o'er.


Meet me there! . . . oh, meet me there I . . .
At the dawning of that morning bright and fair;
Meet me there! . . . oh, meet me there! . . .
In the land beyond the river, meet me there!

There is a City crowned with light,
Its joy no tongue can tell;
For they who enter shall behold the King,
And in His presence dwell.

There is a crown laid up on high,
That Christ the Lord will give
To those who patiently His coming wait,
And for His glory live.

Oh, then, be faithful unto death,
Press on the heavenly way;
That we may enter through the Gates of Life
To realms of endless day.

Brief life is here our portion

Brief life is here our portion;
Brief sorrow, short-lived care;
The life that knows no ending,
The tearless life, is there:
O happy retribution:
Short toil, eternal rest;
For mortals and for sinners
A mansion with the blest.

There grief is turned to pleasure,
Such pleasure, as below
No human voice can utter,
No human heart can know:
And now we fight the battle,
But then shall wear the crown
Of full and everlasting,
And passionless renown.

And there is David's fountain,
And life in fullest glow,
And there the light is golden,
And milk and honey flow;
The light that hath no evening,
The health that hath no sore,
The life that hath no ending,
But lasteth evermore.

'Midst power that knows no limit,
And wisdom free from bound,
The beatific vision
Shall glad the saints around;
For He whom now we trust in
Shall then be seen and known:
And they that know and see Him
Shall have Him for their own.

Yes; God, our King and Portion,
In fulness of His grace
We then shall see for ever,
And worship face to face.
Jesus, in mercy bring us
To that dear land of rest,
Where Thou art with the Father
And Spirit ever blest.

I love to think of the heavenly land

I love to think of the heavenly land,
Where white-robed angels are,
Where many a friend is gathered safe
From fear, and toil, and care.

c
There'll be no parting, there'll be no parting,
There'll be no parting, there'll be no parting there.

I love to think of the heavenly land,
Where my Redeemer reigns,
Where rapturous songs of triumph rise
In endless jovous strains.

I love to think of the heavenly land,
The saints' eternal home,
Where palms, and robes, and crowns ne'er fade,
And all our joys are one.

I love to think of the heavenly land,
The greetings there we'll meet,
The harps—the songs for ever ours —
The walks—the golden streets.

I love to think of the heavenly land,
That promised land so fair;
Oh, how my raptured spirit longs
To be for ever there!


992
Steer our bark away to the Homeland

Steer our bark away to the Homeland,
Spread the sails of hope o'er the sea;
Think of all the friends that awaits us,
When anchored safely there we shall be.

c
Gathering after tears into sunshine,
Gathering after labour into rest; . . .
Hear the ransomed throng shouting forth their joyful song,
Gathering to the mansions of the blest. . ...

Steer our bark away to the Homeland,
On without a fear let us go;
When the port of peace we are nearing,
The blessed harbour lights we shall know.

Bright and fair the hills of the Home-land,
Clad in all the bloom of the spring;
There to Him who loved and redeemed us,
Our joyful, joyful praise we will sing.

Soft the winds that blow from the Home-land,
Sweet the morn that breaks on the shore;
Soon we'll meet again our beloved ones,
Where sorrow, pain, and death come no more.


993
In the land where the bright ones are gathered

In the land where the bright ones are gathered,
In the far-away home where they dwell,
Do they know how our sad hearts are breaking —
Do they know that we love them so well?

c
Do they know, ... do they know, ...
Do they know that we love them so well?
In the land where the bright ones are gathered,
Do they know that we love them so well?

Where they gaze on the splendours of Eden,
On the glories nomortal can tell,
Do they think of the eyes that are weeping —
Do they know that we love them so well?

Do they stoop from the bright realms of glory,
Where the anthems triumphantly swell;
Do they long for a blessed reunion —
Do they know that we love them so well?

Yes, they know; for our spirits are blending,
In the mansion of peace where they dwell;
And they watch and they wait for our coming,
For they know that we love them so well.

Yea, they know, . . . yes, they know, etc.


994
Yes, we'll meet again in the morning

Yes, we'll meet again in the morning,
In the dawn of a fairer day;
When the night of watching and waiting,
With its darkness has passed away;
Where no shadows veil the sunshine,
Over there in the heavenly land,
And the crystal waves of the river
Ever flow o'er the golden sand.

Where our precious ones now are dwelling
Free from toil and from every care;
With their garments spotless and shining,
Like the robes that the angels wear.
When our pilgrimage completed,
And our footsteps no longer roam,
By the pearly gates gladly waiting,
They will give us a welcome home.

Oh, what joy when all shall be over,
And the journey on earth we close,
And the angels homeward shall bear us,
Where the life-stream for ever flows!
We shall see the King of glory,
We shall praise Him with harp and voice;
We shall sing the grace that redeemed us,
While our hearts in His love rejoice.


995
There's a beautiful land that no mortal hath seen

There's a beautiful land that no mortal hath seen,
For it lieth afar from our sight;
But we know that its hills are eternally green,
And its rivers are rivers of light.

c
O beautiful, beautiful land!
O land where all sorrow shall cease!
Where the soul, satisfied, evermore shall abide
By the fair shining river of peace!

Tis a wonderful land, for it knoweth no night,
And its brightness is dimmed by no pain;
For the blessed who dwell 'mid the regions of light
Shall never know sorrow again.

There the songs of redeemed ones for ever arise,
And the King in His beauty they see:
O beautiful land, with thy shadowless skies,
My weary heart yearneth for thee.


996
Climbing up the steeps of glory

Climbing up the steeps of glory,
Loved ones gone before—
See! they wave their hands and call us,
Calling evermore.

c
Come up higher, sister, brother,
To the angel shore;
Live for Jesus, live for glory,
Live to die no more.

See! with radiant look they linger
By the gate so fair;
Wave their golden palms, and bid us
Strive to meet them there.

All their toils on earth are over,
Now with joy they stand;
Hear them calling, ever calling,
From the silent land.


997
Oh, world of joy untold

Oh, world of joy untold,
Beyond the bounds of time,
Where He, the Prince of glory, dwells
In majesty sublime;
There faith, in wonder lost,
Beholds a mighty throng,
Whose grand triumphant chorus fills
That world of love and song.

Through sorrows deep they came,
A path of tears they trod;
But oh, the life for which they toiled
Was hid with Christ in God;
They sing the battle won,
And all their trials past;
And at the feet of Christ the Lord
Their crowns and palms they cast.

No aching hearts are there,
No dreary night of pain;
And they who reach that blest abode
Shall never thirst again;
Beneath the tree so fair,
Whose fruits immortal grow,
They walk with Him who leadeth them
Where living fountains flow.


998
When we gather at last over Jordan

When we gather at last over Jordan,
And the ransomed in glory we see,
' As the numberless sands of the sea- shore —
What a wonderful sight that will be!

c
Numberless as the sands of the seashore!
Numberless as the sands of the shore! . . .
Oh, what a sight 'twill be,
When the ransomed host we see,
As numberless as the sands of the seashore!

When we see all the saved of the ages,
Who from sorrow and trials are free,
Meeting there with a heavenly greeting—
What a wonderful sight that will be!

When we stand by the beautiful river,
'Neath the shade of the life-giving tree,
Gazing over the fair land of promise —
What a wonderful sight that will be!

When at last we behold our Redeemer,
And His glory transcendent we see,
While as King of all kingdoms He reigneth —
What a wonderful sight that will be!


999
Hark! hark! the song the ransomed sing

Hark! hark! the song the ransomed sing,
A new-made song of praise;
The Lord the Lamb they glorify,
And these the strains they raise:

c
"Glory to Him who loved us,
And washed us in His blood;
Who cleansed our souls from guilt and sin,
By that pure, living flood!"

"Made white by His redeeming blood,
Our heavenly garments shine;
Our minds, by Him enlightened, prove
The power of truth divine,

"By Jesus' blood we overcame
When Satan's host assailed;
'Twas by the power of truth divine
Our feeble arms prevailed.

"Then be the Lamb of God adored —
The Lord of life and light!
To Him be glory, honour, power,
And majesty and might!"


1000
Shall we gather at the river

Shall we gather at the river
Where bright angel-feet have trod;
With its crystal tide for ever
Flowing by the throne of God?

c
Yes, we'll gather at the river,
The beautiful, the beautiful river;
Gather with the saints at the river,
That flows by the throne of God.

On the margin of the river,
Washing up its silver spray,
We will walk and worship ever
All the happy, golden day.

Ere we reach the shining river,
Lay we every burden down;
Grace our spirits will deliver,
And provide a robe and crown.

At the shining of the river,
Mirror of the Saviour's face,
Saints whom death will never sever
Raise their songs of saving grace.

Soon we'll reach the silver river,
Soon our pilgrimage will cease;
Soon our happy hearts will quiver
With the melody of peace.


1001
We shall reach the summer land

We shall reach the summer land,
Some sweet day, by and by;
We shall press the golden strand,
Some sweet day, by and by.
Oh, the loved ones watching there.
By the Tree of Life so fair,
Till we come their joy to share,
Some sweet day, by and by!

c
By . . and . . by, . .
Some sweet day,
We shall meet our loved ones gone,
Some sweet day, by and by.

At the crystal river's brink,
We shall find each broken link,
Then the star that, fading here,
Left our hearts and homes so drear,
We shall see more bright and clear,
Some sweet day, by and by.

Oh, these parting scenes will end,
We shall gather friend with friend,
There before our Father's throne,
When the mists and clouds have flown,
We shall know as we are known,
Some sweet day, by and by.


1002
Songs of gladness—never sadness

Songs of gladness—never sadness—
Sing the ransomed ones of heaven;
Anthems swelling, ever telling
Of the joy of souls forgiven.

c
Sweetest music ever swelling
Through the courts of heaven above:
Ever singing, ever saying,
"God is Life, and God is Love '"

Ever sunshine—never shadow —
Calm, mild, clear, celestial day;
Ever summer in its brightness,
Never winter or decay.

Ever gazing, loving, praising,
With the antze hosts above;
One eternal" Hallelujah!"
One eternal so ig of love.

Never sighing, never sinning;
No distrust, nor doubt, nor fears;
Through the long unending ages,
Through the long eternal years.


1003
Who are these, whose songs are sounding

"Who are these, whose songs are sounding
O'er the golden harps above?"
Hark! they tell of grace abounding,
And Jehovah's sovereign love.

c
"These are they . . . who washed their robes . . .
and made them white ... in the blood of the Lamb." . . .

"Who are these that keep their station
Round the great eternal throne?
"They from earthly tribulation
To their heavenly rest are gone.

See their robes of dazzling whiteness,
Without blemish, spot, or stain;
See their crowns that grow in brightness,
Purchased by the Lamb once slain.

'Tis the Lamb of God who leads them,
And they serve Him night and day;
By the heavenly fount He feeds them,
He hath wiped their tears away.

Sweet their theme: 'tis still" salvation
Unto Christ the Holy One";
And their sighs of tribulation
Change to songs around the throne.


1004
Come, let us join our friends above

Come, let us join our friends above
That have obtained the prize,
And on the eagle wings of love
To joy celestial rise.

Let all the saints terrestrial sing
With those to glory gone;
For all the servants of our King,
In earth and heaven, are one.

One family, we dwell in Him,
One Church, above, beneath,
Though now divided by the stream,
The narrow stream of death;

One army of the living God,
To His command we bow;
Part of His host hath crossed the flood,
And part is crossing now.

Our spirits too shall quickly join
Like theirs with glory crowned,
And shout to see our Captain's sign,
To hear His trumpet sound.

Oh that we now might grasp our Guide!
Oh that the word were given!
Come, Lord of Hosts, the waves divide,
And land us all in heaven.


1005
In the fadeless springtime, on the heavenly shore

In the fadeless springtime, on the heavenly shore,
Kindred spirits wait us, who have gone before;
There no flowers wither, and no pleasures cloy,
In that land of beauty, in that home of joy.

c
By the gate they'll meet us, 'neath that golden sky.
Meet us at the portal—meet us by and by.

In the misty gloaming death awaits us all;
Silent is his coming, sure the Master's call;
And the angel footsteps mark the upward way,
Till the twilight merges into heavenly day.

Trusting in the Saviour, may we humbly wait
Till the holy angels ope the pearly gate,
And the loving Father, from His gracious throne,
Smiling, bids us welcome to our heavenly home.


1006
Meet me there! oh, meet me there!

Meet me there! oh, meet me there!
In the heavenly world so fair,
Where our Lord has entered in,
And there comes no taint of sin;
With our friends of long ago,
Clad in raiment white as snow,
Such as all the ransomed wear—
Meet me there! yes, meet me there!

Meet me there! oh, meet me there!
Far beyond this world of care;
When this troubled life shall cease,
Meet me where is perfect peace;
Where our sorrows we lay down
For the kingdom and the crown,
Jesus does a home prepare —
Meet me there! yes, meet me there!

Meet me there! oh, meet me there!
No bereavements we shall bear;
There no sighings for the dead,
There no farewell tear is shed;
We shall, safe from all alarms,
Clasp our loved ones in our arms,
And in Jesus' glory share—
Meet me there! yes, meet me there!

Well you meet me in the morning

Well you meet me in the morning,
On that bright and golden shore?
Will your lamp be trimmed and burning,
When He comes to take you o'er?

c
Yes, I'll meet . . . you in the morn---ing,
When I hear . . . the Saviour's call; . . .
"Come, ye bles sed of My Fa ther,
To a home . . . prepared for all." . . .

Oh to meet on that bright morning,
When the clouds have passed away!
Oh to walk and talk with Jesus,
There to dwell with Him for aye!

When we meet our loving Saviour,
What a happy hour 'twill be,
When we're gathered with our loved ones,
And their happy faces see!

Oh, this thought should make us happy,
And we all should love Him more;
For He'll come, and will not tarry,
Come to bear us safely o'er.


1008
I am waiting for the Master

I am waiting for the Master,
Who will rise and bid me come
To the glory of His presence,
To the gladness of His home,

c
They are watch ing at the portal,
They are wait ing at the door;
Waiting on---ly for my coming,
All the loved . . . ones gone before.

Many a weary path I've travelled
In the darkest storm and strife,
Bearing many a heavy burden,
Often struggling for my life.

Many friends who travelled with me,
Reached that portal long ago;
One by one they left me battling
With the dark and crafty foe.

Yes, their pilgrimage was shorter,
Aiid their triumph sooner won;
Oh, how lovingly they'll greet me
When the toils of life are done.


1009
Where the faded flower shall freshen

Where the faded flower shall freshen,
Freshen nevermore to fade;
Where the shaded sky shall brighten,
Brighten nevermore to shade;
Where the morn shall wake in gladness,
And the noon the joy prolong;
Where the daylight dies in fragrance,
'Mid the burst of holy song:

c
We shall meet and we shall rest
'Mid the holy and the blest;
We shall meet on yonder shore
With the loved ones gone before;
We shall meet and we shall rest
'Mid the holy and the blest.

Where the love that here we lavish
On the withering leaves of time
Shall have fadeless flowers to fix on
In an ever spring-bright clime;
Where we find the joy of loving
As we never loved before;
Loving on, unchilled, unhindered,
Loving once and evermore:

Where no shadow shall bewilder,
Where life's vain parade is o'er,
Where the sleep of sin is broken,
And the dreamer dreams no more;
Where the child has found the mother,
Where the mother finds the child,
Where the loved ones all are gathered
That were scattered on the wild:

Jerusalem, my happy home

Jerusalem, my happy home,
Name ever dear to me,
When shall my labours have an end
In joy, and peace, and thee?

When shall these eyes thy heaven built walls
And pearly gates behold? —
Thy bulwarks with salvation strong,
And streets of shining gold?

Why should I shrink from pain and woe,
Or feel at death dismay?
I've Canaan's goodly land in view,
And realms of endless day.

Apostles, martyrs, prophets, there
Around my Saviour stand;
And soon my friends in Christ below
Will join the glorious band.

Jerusalem, my happy home,
My soul still pants for thee;
Then shall my labours have an end,
When I thy joys shall see.


1011
We know there's a bright and a glorious home

We know there's a bright and a glorious home,
Away in the heavens high,
Where all the redeemed shall with Jesus dwell:
Will you be there and I?

In robes of white, o'er streets of gold,
Beneath a cloudless sky,
They walk in the light of their Father's love:
Will you be there and I?

From every kingdom of earth they come,
To join the triumphal cry
Of" Worthy the Lamb that once was slain!"
Will you be there and I?

If we take the loving Saviour now,
And follow Him faithfully —
When He gathers His children in that bright home,
Then you'll be there, and I!


1012
In the land of fadeless day

In the land of fadeless day
Lies" the city four-square";
It shall never pass away,
And there is" no night there."

God shall" wipe . . away all tears"; . .
There's no death, . . no pain, nor fears; . .
And they count . . not time by years, . .
For there is ..." no night there."

All the gates of pearl are made
In" the city four-square";
All the streets with gold are laid,
And there is" no night there."

And the gates shall never close
To" the city four-square,"
There life's crystal river flows,
And there is" no night there."

There they need no sunshine bright
In" the city four-square,"
For the Lamb is all the light,
And there is" no night there."

Beckoning hands at the gateway to- night

Beckoning hands at the gateway to- night,
Faces a-shining with radiant light;
Eyes looking down from yon heavenly home,
Beautiful hands, they are beckoning" Come."

c
Beautiful hands, beckoning hands,
Calling the dear ones to heavenly lands;
Beautiful hands, beckoning hands,
Beautiful, beautiful beckoning hands,

Beckoning hands of a mother, whose love
Sacrificed life its devotion to prove;
Hands of a father, to memory dear,
Beckon up higherthe waiting ones here.

Beckoning hands of a little one, see!
Baby-voice calling, O mother, for thee;
Rosy-cheeked darling, the light of the home,
Taken so early, is beckoning" Come."

Beckoning hands of a husband, a wife,
Watching and waiting the loved one of life;
Hands of a brother, a sister, a friend,
Out from the gateway to-night they extend.

Brightest and best of that glorious throng,
Centre of all, and the theme of their song—
Jesus, our Saviour, the pierced One,stands,
Lovingly calling with beckoning hands.


1014
I saw a way-worn traveller

I saw a way-worn traveller,
In tattered garments clad,
And struggling up the mountain,
It seemed that he was sad;
His back was laden heavy,
His strength was almost gone,
Yet he shouted as he journeyed,
"Deliverance will come!"

c
Then palms of victory, crowns of glory
Palms of victory I shall bear."

The summer sun was shining,
The sweat was on his brow,
His garments worn and dusty,
His step seemed very slow;
But he kept pressing onward,
For he was wending home,
Still shouting as he journeyed,
"Deliverance will come!"

The songsters in the arbour
That stood beside the way
Attracted his attention,
Inviting his delay:
His watchword being" Onward!"
He stopped his ears and ran,
Still shouting as he journeyed,
"Deliverance will come!"

I saw him in the evening;
The sun was bending low;
He'd overtopped the mountain,
And reached the vale below:
He saw the Golden City—
His everlasting home,—
And shouted loud, "Hosanna!
Deliverance will come!"

While gazing on that City,
Just o'er the narrow flood,
A band of holy angels
Came from the throne of God;
They bore him on their pinions
Safe o'er the dashing foam,
And joined him in his triumph:
Deliverance had come!

I heard the song of triumph
They sang upon that shore,
Saying, "Jesus has redeemed us
To suffer nevermore!
"Then, casting his eyes backward
On the race which he had run,
He shouted loud, "Hosanna!
Deliverance has come!


1015
O Banner of Jesus, in triumph advancing

O Banner of Jesus, in triumph advancing,
Thy folds in the sunlight of beauty unfurled;
From the hill sides afar to the isles of the ocean,
Thy glory shall float till it conquers the world.

c
O Banner of Jesus, thou glory-crowned Banner,
Thou emblem of hope o'er the nations unfurled;
March on in triumph, march on in beauty,
Till Jesus, till Jesus has conquered the world.

Oh say, can you see where the ranks are now marching?
With banners of beauty like con- querors they come;
They have fought the good fight, and in peace are returning,
The ransomed of Zion; oh, welcome them home!

Behold where they stand on the green hills immortal,
Their weapons unheeded, they rest on the shore;
There, with heroes and martyrs in glory reposing,
Their warfare is ended, they weary no more.


1016
There is a land of pure delight

There is a land of pure delight,
Where saints immortal reign;
Eternal day excludes the night,
And pleasures banish pain.
There everlasting spring abides,
And never-withering flowers;
Death, like a narrow sea, divides
This heavenly land from ours.

Sweet fields beyond the swelling flood
Stand dressed in living green;
So to the Jews old Canaan stood,
While Jordan rolled between.
Could we but climb where Moses stood,
And view the landscape o'er,
Not Jordan's stream, nor death's cold flood,
Should fright us from the shore.


1017
Over the river faces I see

Over the river faces I see,
Fair as the morning, looking for me;
Free from their sorrow, grief, and despair,
Waiting and watching patiently there.

c
Looking this way, yes, looking this way,
Loved ones are waiting, looking this way;
Fair as the morning, bright as the day,
Dear ones in glory looking this way.

Father and mother, safe in the vale,
Watch for the boatman, wait for the sail,
Bearing the loved ones over the tide
Into the harbour, near to their side.

Brother and sister gone to that clime,
Wait for the others coming some time;
Safe with the angels, whiter than snow,
Watching for dear ones waiting below.

Sweet little darling, light of the home,
Looking for someone, beckoning,Come;
Bright as a sunbeam, pure as the dew.
Anxiously looking, mother, for you.

Jesus the Saviour, bright Morning Star,
Looking for lost ones, straying afar;
Hear the glad message, why will you roam?
Jesus is calling,"Sinner, come home!"


1018
O Homeland! O Homeland! no lonely heart is there

O Homeland! O Homeland! no lonely heart is there,
No rush of blinding anguish, no slowly dropping tear:
Now, like an infant crying its mother's face to see,
O blessed, blessed Homeland, I stretch my arms to thee!

O Homeland! O Homeland! whose joy no tongue can tell,
No sighing of the weary, no more the sad farewell;
But sound of children's voices, and shout of saintly song,
Are heard thy happy highways and golden streets along.

O Homeland! O Homeland! the vail is very thin
That stretches thy fair meadows and this cold world between:
A breath aside may blow it, a heart throb burst it through,
And bring, in one glad moment, the pearly gates in view.

O Homeland! O Homeland! One — Chief of all thy band,
One—altogether lovely, One—Lord of all the land,
Now standeth at thy portals to welcome there His Bride,
And, resting on His bosom, I shall be satisfied.


1019
There's a land of life and glory

There's a land of life and glory,
Just beyond the shores of time,
Where redemption's wondrous story
Is the theme of song sublime.

c
Boundless love . . . and adoration, . . .
Boundless glo---ries none have dreamed,. . .
Boundless joy ... of free salvation— . . .
Is the song . . . of the redeemed. . . .

Who shall sing the song of gladness
Through the everlasting years,
When there cometh no more sadness,
No more sighing, no more tears?

Who shall sing of God's salvation?
Who eternal life shall win?
They who came through tribulation,
And have triumphed over sin.

These are they who follow Jesus,
Counting earthly gain but loss;
These are they who found salvation
Through His death upon the cross.


1020
High in yonder heavenly courts the ransomed sing

High in yonder heavenly courts the ransomed sing,
Casting down their golden crowns before their King,
Banished every grief and fear and earthly wrong,
While the saints redeemed now join the glad new song.

c
Sing---ing to the Lamb . . . who once was slain on Calvary; . . .
Sing---ing to the Lamb . . . who lives through all eternity!

Oh, the wondrous song of Love, at last complete!
Oh, the golden vials, full of odours sweet;
Through the risen Saviour, once for sinners slain,
We as kings and priests to God shall ever reign.

Only those whose robes are washed can join that throng,
None but lips attuned by grace can sing that song;
Cleanse us, blessed Saviour, from the stain of sin;
Let the glorious song of rapture now begin!


1021
Who, who are these beside the chilly wave

Who, who are these beside the chilly wave,
Just on the borders of the silent grave,
Shouting Jesus' power to save,
"Washed in the blood of the Lamb"?

c
"Sweeping through the gates" of the New Jerusalem,"
"Washed in the blood of the Lamb."

These, these are they who, in their youthful days,
Found Jesus early, and in wisdom's ways
Proved the fulness of His grace,
"Washed in the blood of the Lamb."

These, these are they who, in affliction's woes,
Ever have found in Jesus calm repose,
Such as from a pure heart flows,
"Washed in the blood of the Lamb."

These, these are they who, in the conflict dire,
Boldly have stood amid the hottest fire;
Jesus now says:" Come up higher,"
"Washed in the blood of the Lamb."

Safe, safe upon the ever-shining shore,
Sin, pain, and death, and sorrow, all are o'er;
Happy now and evermore,
"Washed in the blood of the Lamb."


1022
Oh, the peaceful resting land

Oh, the peaceful resting land,
Where the saints in glory,
Bending at the Saviour's feet,
Tell the grand old story.

c
Sweetly they are singing, . . .
Hear the echo ringing, . .
In the land of beauty--
Blessed land of song!

Where the cloudless beams of day
Banish care and sadness;
Lo, the reapers enter now,
Bearing sheaves of gladness.

Oh, the tender, loving words,
Purest joy revealing!
Soft and low from kindred souls,
On the twilight stealing.

Soon together we shall stand
By the crystal river,
There to join the holy throng,
Praising God for ever.


1023
With harps and with vials there stand a great throng

With harps and with vials there stand a great throng,
In the presence of Jesus, and sing this new song:

c
Unto Him who hath loved us and washed us from sin,
Unto Him be the glory for ever. Amen.

All these once were sinners, defiled in His sight,
Now arrayed in pure garments in praise they unite:

He maketh the rebel a priest and a king;
He hath bought us, and taught us this new song to sing:

How helpless and hopeless we sinners had been,
If He never had loved us till cleansed from our sin!

Aloud in His praises our voices shall ring,
So that others, believing, this new song shall sing:


1024
Ten thousand times ten thousand

Ten thousand times ten thousand,
In sparkling raiment bright,
The armies of the ransomed saints
Throng up the steeps of light;
'Tis finished—all is finished—
Their fight with death and sin!
Fling open wide the golden gates,
And let the victors in.

c
Hallelujah! Hallelujah to the Lamb who once was slain
Hallelujah! Hallelujah to Him who lives again!

What rush of" Hallelujahs"
Fills all the earth and sky!
What ringing of a thousand harps
Bespeaks the triumphs nigh!
O day, for which creation
And all its tribes were made!
Oh, joy! for all its former woes
A thousandfold repaid!

Oh, then what raptured greetings
On Canaan's happy shore!
What knitting severed friendships up,
Where partings are no more!
Than eyes with joy shall sparkle
That brimmed with tears of late;
No longer orphans, fatherless,
Nor widows desolate.


1025
Out of the shadow-land, into the sunshine

Out of the shadow-land, into the sunshine,
Cloudless, eternal, that fades not away;
Softly and tenderly Jesus will call us
Home, where the ransomed are gathering to-day.

Silently, peacefully, angels will bear us
Into the beautiful mansions above;
There shall we rest from earth's toiling for ever,
Safe in the arms of God's infinite love.

Out of the shadow-land, weary and changeful,
Out of the valley of sorrow and night,
Into the rest of the life everlasting,
Into the summer of endless delight.

Out of the shadow-land, over life's ocean,
Into the rapture and joy of the Lord,
Safe in the Father's house, welcomed by angels,
Ours the bright crown and eternal reward.


1026
There'll be no dark valley when Jesus comes

There'll be no dark valley when Jesus comes,
There'll be no dark valley when Jesus comes,
There'll be no dark valley when Jesus comes
To gather His loved ones home.

c
To gather His loved ones home, . .
To gather His loved ones home; . .
There'll be no dark valley when Jesus comes
To gather His loved ones home.

There'll be no more sorrow when Jesus comes,
There'll be no more sorrow when Jesus comes;
But a glorious morrow when Jesus comes
To gather His loved ones home.

There'll be no more weeping when Jesus comes,
There'll be no more weeping when Jesus comes;
But a blessed reaping when Jesus comes
To gather His loved ones home.

There'll be songs of greeting when Jesus comes,
There'll be songs of greeting when Jesus comes;
And a joyful meeting when Jesus comes
To gather His loved ones home.


1027
The tide is flowing out, is flowing out

The tide is flowing out, is flowing out;
And we upon its bosom borne
Are drifting to the sea;
Drifting toward the portals of the boundless sea,
Past all mortal vision to Eternity.

c
Drifting . . nearer . . to the sea of Eternity;
Drifting . . nearer . . to the sea of Eternity.

The tide is flowing out, is flowing out;
And some upon its bosom borne
Are drifting to the sea;
Drifting on to glory, past all pain and care,
Into heaven's brightness where the ransomed are.

The tide is flowing out, is flowing out,
And others on its bosom borne
Are drifting to the sea;
Drifting out to darkness, far from love and light,
Where the storms are raging, into endless night.

The tide is flowing out, is flowing out;
But hark! upon its bosom borne
A voice floats o'er the sea;
'Tis the Saviour calling to His sheltering breast,
"Come to Me, ye weary, I will give you rest."


1028
On the Resurrection morning

On the Resurrection morning,
Soul and body meet again;
No more sorrow, no more weeping,
No more pain.

Here awhile they must be parted,
And the fiesh its Sabbath keep;
Waiting in a holy stillness,
Wrapped in sleep.

For a space the tired body
Waits in peace the morning's dawn,
When there breaks the last and brightest
Easter mora.

On that happy Easter morning
All the graves their dead restore—
Father, sister, child, and mother,
Meet once more.

Soul and body, reunited,
Thenceforth nothing shall divide;
Waking up in Christ's own likeness,
Satisfied.


1029
Only waiting till the shadows

Only waiting till the shadows
Are a little longer grown;
Only waiting till the glimmer
Of the day's last beam is flown:
Till the night of earth has faded
From the heart once full of day;
Till the stars of heaven are breaking
Through the twilight soft and grey.

Only waiting till the reapers
Have the last sheaf gathered home;
For the summer time has faded,
And the autumn winds have come.
Quickly, reapers! gather quickly
All the ripe hours of my heart;
For the bloom of life is withered,
And I hasten to depart.

Only waiting till the angels
Open wide the pearly gate,
At whose portals long I've lingered,
Weary, poor, and desolate:
Even now I hear their footsteps,
And their voices far away;
If they call me, I am waiting,
Only waiting to obey.

Waiting for a brighter dwelling
Than I ever yet have seen,
Where the tree of life is blooming,
And the fields are ever green:
Waiting for my full redemption,
When my Saviour shall restore
All that sin has caused to wither:
Pain and sorrow come no more.


1030
Soon shall we see the glorious morning

Soon shall we see the glorious morning!
Saints, arise! saints, arise!
Sinners, attend the notes of warning!
Saints, arise! saints, arise!
The Resurrection Day draws near,
The King of saints shall soon appear,
And high His royal standard rear:
Saints, arise! saints, arise!

Hear ye the trump of God resounding,
Saints, arise! saints, arise!
Through death's dark vaults its notes rebounding:
Saints, arise! saints, arise!
To meet the Bridegroom haste! prepare!
Put on your bridal garments fair;
And hail your Saviour in the air!
Saints, arise! saints, arise!

The saints who sleep, with joy awaken,
All arise! all arise!
Their clay-cold beds are quick forsaken,
Ali arise! all arise!
Not one of all the faithful few
Who here on earth the Saviour knew,
But starts with bliss his Lord to view:
All arise! all arise!

Fast by the throne of God behold them
Crowned at last! crowned at last!
See in His arms the Saviour fold them,
Crowned at last! crowned at last!
With wreaths of glory round their head;
Notears ofsorrow noware shed,
To joy's full fountain all are led:
Crowned at last! crowned at last!


1031
One by one we cross the river

One by one we cross the river,
One by one we're passing o'er;
One by one the crowns are given,
On the bright and happy shore;
Youth and childhood oft are passing
O'er the dark and rolling tide;
And the blessed Holy Spirit
Is the dying Christian's Guide;
And the loving, gentle Spirit
Bears them o'er the rolling tide.

One by one we come to Jesus,
As we heed His gentle voice;
One by one His vineyard enter,
There to labour and rejoice:
One by one sweet flowers we gather
In the glorious work of love,
Garlands for the blessed Saviour
Gather for the realms above;
And the loving, gentle Spirit
Bears them to our home of love.

One by one the heavy-laden
Sink beneath the noontide sun;
And the aged pilgrim welcomes
Evening shadows as they come.
One by one, with sins forgiven,
May we stand upon the shore,
Waiting till the blessed Spirit
Takes our hand and guides us o'er,
Till the loving, gentle Spirit
Leads us to the shining shore!


1032
Pray, brethren, pray

Pray, brethren, pray!
The sands are falling;
Pray, brethren, pray!
God's voice is calling.
Yon turret strikes the dying chime;
We kneel upon the verge of time:

c
Eternity is drawing nigh!
Eternity is drawing nigh!

Praise, brethren, praise!
The skies are rending;
Praise, brethren, praise!
The fight is ending;
Behold, the glory draweth near,
The King Himself will soon appear:

Watch, brethren, watch!
The year is dying;
Watch, brethren, watch!
Old time is flying!
Watch as men watch the parting breath,
Watch as men watch for life or death:

Look, brethren, look!
The day is breaking;
Hark, brethren, hark!
The dead are waking:
With girded loins all ready stand;
Behold, the Bridegroom is at hand!

c
Eternity is drawing nigh!
Eternity is drawing nigh I is drawing nigh!


1033
When for me the sunlight gleams

When for me the sunlight gleams,
And life's fairest flowers bloom,
Joy into my bosom streams,
Driving out the mists and gloom;
When the skies are bright and fair,
And sweet music fills the air,
Then I'll praise His name so dear:
Jesus! Jesus! Light of life to me!
Jesus! Jesus! Love so full and free!

When the fondest hopes shall die,
And like roses scattered lie,
When my heart, bowed down with grief,
Sadly sighs for some relief;
To His tender, loving heart
Would I then my grief impart;
Then I rest, sweet rest shall find:
Jesus! Jesus! Light of life to me!
Jesus! Jesus! Love so full and free!

When for me the end shall come,
And from earthly scenes I glide;
When my bark drifts slowly out,
O'er the river's sullen tide;
When my raptured vision falls
On the fair, celestial walls,
Joy and peace shall then be mine:
Jesus! Jesus! I shall ever see;
Jesus! Jesus! through eternity!


1034
Grand is the song of the Easter morn

Grand is the song of the Easter morn,
Victory is won! victory is won!
Far o'er the hills with the light 'tis borne,
Victory is won through Christ!
Chasing the shades of night away,
Bringing the light of glorious day,
Taking from Death his strength and sway,
Victory is won through Christ!

Grand was the scene when the stone was rolled,
Off from the sepulchre dark and cold:
Angels alone could view that sight;
Man could not bear that vision bright;
Forth came the Conqueror armed with might,
Victory is won through Christ!

Grand was the word that the women brought,
Mingled with wonders, with glories fraught:
"Seek not the living, "the angels said,
"Seek not the living among the dead";
Sorrow is past and night is fled,
Victory is won through Christ!

Grand is this truth, O saints, for you,
Yours is the joy and the blessing too,
Since Jesus took from Death bis key,
He from the tomb will set us free;
And through all time and eternity,
Victory is won through Christ!


1035
Why should we start, and fear to die

Why should we start, and fear to die!
What timorous worms we mortals are!
Death is the gate of endless joy;
And yet we dread to enter there.

The pains, the groans, the dying strife
Fright our approaching souls away;
We still shrink back again to life,
Fond of our prison and our clay.

Oh, if my Lord would come and meet,
My soul should stretch her wings in haste,
Fly fearless through death's iron gate,
Nor feel the terrors as she passed!

Jesus can make a dying bed
Feel soft as downy pillows are;
While on His breast I lean my head,
And breathe my life out sweetly there.


1036
Asleep in Jesus! blessed sleep

Asleep in Jesus! blessed sleep!
From which none ever wake to weep;
A calm and undisturbed repose,
Unbroken by the last of foes.

Asleep in Jesus! oh, how sweet
To be for such a slumber meet!
With holy confidence to sing
That death hath lost its venomed sting!

Asleep in Jesus! peaceful rest!
Whose waking is supremely blest;
No fear—no woe—shall dim the hour
That manifests the Saviour's power.

Asleep in Jesus! oh, for me
May such a blissful refuge be!
Securely shall my ashes lie,
And wait the summons from on high.

Asleep in Jesus! far from thee
Thy kindred and their graves may be:
But thine is still a blessed sleep
From which none ever wake to weep.


1037
We shall sleep, but not for ever

We shall sleep, but not for ever,
There will be a glorious dawn!
We shall meet to part—no, never,
On the resurrection morn!
From the deepest caves of ocean,
From the desert and the plain,
From the valley and the mountain,
Countless throngs shall rise again.

c
We shall sleep, but not for ever,
There will be a glorious dawn;
We shall meet to part—no, never,
On the resurrection morn!

When we see a precious blossom
That we tended with such care,
Rudely taken from our bosom,
How our aching hearts despair!
Round its little grave we linger,
Till the setting sun is low,
Feeling all our hopes have perished
With the flower we cherished so.

We shall sleep, but not for ever,
In the lone and silent grave;
Blessed be the Lord that taketh,
Blessed be the Lord that gave.
In the bright, eternal city
Death can never, never come!
In His own good time He'll call us
From our rest to Home, sweet Home.


1038
I must walk through the valley of the shadow

I must walk through the valley of the shadow,
But I'll journey in a loving Saviour's care;
He hath said He will never, neverleave me,
With His" staff" He will comfort me there.

c
Through the valley, through the valley,
Through the valley of the shadow I must go;
But the dark waves of Jordan will not harm me,
There is peace in the valley, I know.

When I walk through the valley of the shadow,
All the weary days of toiling will be o'er;
For the strong arms of Jesus will enfold me,
And with Him I shall sorrow no more.

Though I walk through the valley of the shadow,
Yet the glory of the dawning I shall see;
I shall join in the anthems over Jordan,
Where the loved ones are waiting for me.

I shall walk through the valley of the shadow,
I shall follow where my Lord has gone before;
Through the mists of the valley He will lead me,
Till I rest on the Ever-green Shore.


1039
Will there be light at eventide

Will there be light at eventide,
When my bark unmoors for sea?
Will faith's bright ray illume the way?
Oh, will there be light for me?

c
Will there be light? . . . Oh, will there be light? . . .
Oh, will there be light for me, for me?
Will there be light at eventide,
When my bark unmoors for sea?

When I draw near the other shore,
Will there be a shining band
Of those I knew and loved on earth
Awaiting me on the strand?

c
Will there be light? . . . Oh, will there be light? . . .
Oh, will there be light for me, for me?
Will there be light of faces bright
On the banks of the crystal sea?

On yonder shore are the golden gates
That lead to the city fair,
Where Jesus stands, with outstretched hands
To bid me welcome there.

c
There will be light, . . . Oh, there will be light! . . .
Oh, there will be light for me, for me:
He is the Light of glory bright
That shone on Calvary!

Thou art gone to the grave, but we will not deplore thee

Thou art gone to the grave, but we will not deplore thee,
Though sorrows and darkness en- compass the tomb;
The Saviour has passed through its portal before thee,
And the lamp of His love is thy guide through the gloom.

Thou art gone to the grave, we no longer behold thee,
Nor tread the rough path of the world by thy side;
But the wide arms of mercy are spread to enfold thee,
And sinners may hope, since the Sinless has died.

Thou art gone to the grave; and, its mansion forsaking,
Perhaps thy weak spirit in fear lingered long;
But the sunshine of Paradise beamed on thy waking,
And the sound which thou heard'st was the seraphim's song.

Thou art gone to the grave, but 'twere wrong to deplore thee,
For God was thy ransom, thy guardian, and guide;
He gave thee, He took thee, and He will restore thee;
And death has no sting, since the Saviour has died.


1041
Sleep on, beloved, sleep, and take thy rest

Sleep on, beloved, sleep, and take thy rest;
Lay down thy head upon thy Saviour's breast:
We love thee well; but Jesus loves thee best —
Good-night! Good-night! Goodnight!

Calm is thy slumber as an infant's sleep;
But thou shalt wake no more to toil and weep:
Thine is a perfect rest, secure and deep —
Good-night! Good-night! Goodnight!

Until the shadows from this earth are cast;
Until He gathers in His sheaves at last;
Until the twilight gloom is overpast —
Good-night! Good-night! Goodnight!

Until the Easter glory lights the skies;
Until the dead in Jesus shall arise,
And He shall come, but not in lowly guise —
Good-night! Good-night! Goodnight!

Until made beautiful by Love Divine,
Thou in the likeness of thy Lord shalt shine,
And He shall bring that golden crown of thine—
Good-night! Good-night! Goodnight!

Only" good-night, "beloved—not farewell!"
A little while, and all His saints shall dwell
In hallowed union, indivisible—
Good-night! Good-night! Goodnight!

Until we meet again before His throne,
Clothed in the spotless robe He gives His own,
Until we know even as we are known —
Good-night! Good-night! Goodnight!


1042
It is not time that flies, 'tis we, 'tis we are flying

It is not time that flies, 'tis we, 'tis we are flying;
It is not life that dies, 'tis we, 'tis we are dying.
Time and eternity are one,
Time is eternity begun:
Time changes, but without decay,
'Tis we alone who pass away.


It is not truth that flies, 'tis we, 'tis we are flying;
It is not faith that dies, 'tis we, 'tis we are dying.
Oever-during Faith and Truth,
Whose youth is age, whose age is youth;
Twin stars of immortality,
Ye cannot perish from the sky.

It is not hope that flies, 'tis we, 'tis we are flying;
It is not love that dies, 'tis we, 'tis we are dying.
Twin streams that have in heaven your birth,
Ye glide in gentle joy through earth;
We fade like flowers beside you sown —
Ye are still flowing, flowing on.

Yet we but die to live, it is from death we're flying;
For ever lives our life, for us there is no dying.
We die, but as the spring-bud dies,
In summer's golden glow to rise;
These be our days of vernal bloom.
Our harvest is beyond the tomb.


1043
Oh, the clanging bells of Time

Oh, the clanging bells of Time!
Night and day they never cease;
We are wearied with their chime,
For they do not bring us peace;
And we hush our breath to hear,
And we strain our eyes to see,
If thy shores are drawing near:
Eternity! Eternity!

Oh, the clanging bells of Time!
How their changes rise and fall;
But in undertone sublime,
Sounding clearly through them all,
Is a voice that must be heard,
As our moments onward flee;
And it speaketh aye one word:
Eternity! Eternity!

Oh, the clanging bells of Time!
To their voices, loud and low,
In a long, unresting line
We are marching to and fro;
And we yearn for sight or sound
Of the life that is to be,
For thy breath doth wrap us round:
Eternity! Eternity!

Oh, the clanging bells of Time!
Soon their notes will all be dumb,
And in joy and peace sublime
We shall feel the silence come!
And our souls their thirst will slake,
And our eyes the King will see,
When thy glorious morn shall break:
Eternity! Eternity!


1044
As shadows cast by cloud and sun

As shadows cast by cloud and sun,
Flit o'er the summer grass,
So, in Thy sight, Almighty One,
Earth's generations pass

c
Flit - ting away, . flit - ting away, . .
Flitting like the shadows away; . .
Flit - ting away, . flit - ting away, . .
Flitting like the shadows away. . .

And while the years, in endless host,
Come passing swiftly on,
The brightest name that earth can boast
But glistens, and is gone.

Yet doth the Star of Bethlehem shed
A lustre pure and sweet,
And still it leads, as once it led,
To the Messiah's feet.

O Father, may that Holy Star
Grow every year more bright,
And shed its glorious beams afar
To fill the world with light


1045
Fade, fade, each earthly joy; Jesus is mine

Fade, fade, each earthly joy; Jesus is mine!
Break every tender tie; Jesus is mine!
Dark is the wilderness, earth has no resting-place,
Jesus alone can bless, Jesus is mine!

Tempt not my soul away; Jesus is mine!
Here would I ever stay; Jesus is mine!
Perishing things of clay, bora but for one brief day,
Pass from my heart away! Jesus is mine!

Farewell, ye dreams of night; Jesus is mine!
Lost in this dawning light; Jesus is mine!
All that my soul has tried left but a dismal void,
Jesus has satisfied; Jesus is mine!

Farewell, mortality; Jesus is mine!
Welcome, eternity; Jesus is mine!
Welcome, O loved and blest; welcome, sweet scenes of rest;
Welcome, my Saviour's breast; Jesus is mine!


1046
Days and moments quickly flying

Days and moments quickly flying,
Blend the living with the dead;
Soon will you and I be lying
Each within our narrow bed.

Soon our souls to God who gave them
Will have sped their rapid flight;
Able now by grace to save them—
Oh, that while we can we might!

Jesus, Infinite Redeemer,
Maker of this mortal frame,
Teach, oh, teach us to remember
What we are, and whence we came.

c
Life passeth soon; Death draweth near:
Keep us, good Lord, till Thou appear;
For Thee to l»ve, in Thee to die,
With Thee to reign through Eternity. Amen.


1047
While, with ceaseless course, the sun

While, with ceaseless course, the sun
Hasted through the former year,
Many souls their race have run,
Nevermore to meet us here:
Fixed in an eternal state,
They have done with all below:
We a little longer wait;
But how little, none can know..

As the winged arrow flies
Speedily the mark to find;
As the lightning from the skies
Darts, and leaves no trace behind —
Swiftly thus our fleeting days
Bear us down life's rapid stream;
Upward, Lord, our spirits raise!
All below is but a dream.

Thanks for mercies past receive;
Pardon of our sins renew;
Teach us henceforth how to live,.
With eternity in view:
Bless Thy Word to old and young;
Fill us with a Saviour's love;
When our life's short race is run,
May we dwell with Thee above.


1048
Come, Thou Fount of every blessing

Come, Thou Fount of every blessing,
Tune my heart to sing Thy grace;
Streams of mercy, never ceasing,
Call for songs of loudest praise.

Here I'll raise my Ebenezer.
Hither by Thy help I'm come;
And I hope, by Thy good pleasure,
Safely to arrive at home.

Jesus sought me when a stranger,
Wandering from the fold of God;
He, to rescue me from danger,
Interposed His precious blood.

Oh, to grace how great a debtor
Daily I'm constrained to be!
Let Thy grace, Lord, like a fetter,
Bind my wandering heart to Thee.

Prone to wander, Lord, I feel it;
Prone to leave the God I love;
Here's my heart, oh, take and seal it.
Seal it for Thy courts above.


1049
Bless, O Lord, the opening year

Bless, O Lord, the opening year
To each soul assembled here;
Clothe Thy word with power divine,
Make us willing to be Thine.

Shepherd of Thy blood-bought sheep,
Teach the stony hearts to weep;
Let the blind have eyes to see,
See themselves, and look to Thee.

Where Thou hast Thy work begun,
Give new strength the race to run;
Scatter darkness, doubts, and fears;
Wipe away the mourner's tears.

Bless us all, both old and young;
Call forth praise from every tongue;
Let this whole assembly prove
All Thy power and all Thy.


1050
For Thy mercy and Thy grace

For Thy mercy and Thy grace,
Faithful through another year,
Hear our song of thankfulness;
Father and Redeemer, hear!

In our weakness and distress,
Rock of Strength, be Thou our stay:
In the pathless wilderness
Be our true and living way.

Who of us death's awful road
In the coming year shall tread.
With Thy rod and staff, O God,
Comfort Thou his dying bed.

Keep us faithful, keep us pure,
Keep us evermore Thine own;
Help, O help us to endure,
Fit us for the promised crown.

So within Thy palace gate
We shall praise, on golden strings,
Thee, the only Potentate,
Lord of lords, and King of kings.


1051
All, all for Thee! Dear Saviour, may this watchword

All, all for Thee! Dear Saviour, may this watchword
Be Thine own keynote for my life this year:
So sweetly harmonising thought and action,
That none who listen shall a discord hear.

All, all for Thee! Oh, take me now entirely!
Retune each note with Thine own gentle hand;
I give myself afresh into Thy keeping,
To do or suffer, as Thou shalt command.

I give my heart—I long to love Thee better
Than ever I have done in years before;
That all I do may be a"joy, not duty";
Lord Jesus, grant it: may I love Thee more!

I give my will—O Master, do receive it;
It must rebel in any care but Thine;
I cannot keep it, it is so self-pleasing:
What rest to think it is no longer mine!

O Master, by Thine own most Holy Spirit,
Send heavenly music o'er the through me,
So true, so beautiful, so soul-refreshing,
That those who hear it may learn more of Thee!


1052
A few more years shall roll

A few more years shall roll,
A few more seasons come,
And we shall be with those that rest
Asleep within the tomb.

Then, O my Lord, prepare
My soul for that great day;
Oh, wash me in Thy precious blood,
And take my sins away.

A few more suns shall set,
O'er these dark hills of time;
And we shall be where suns are not,
A far serener clime.

A few more storms shall beat
On this wild, rocky shore;
And we shall be where tempests cease,
And surges swell no more.

A few more struggles here,
A few more partings o'er;
A few more toils, a few more tears,
And we shall weep no more.

Tis but a little while
And He shall come again,
Who died that we might live; who lives
That we with Him may reign.


1053
We plough the fields, and scatter

We plough the fields, and scatter
The good seed on the land;
But it is fed and watered
By God's almighty hand:
He sends the snow in winter,
The warmth to swell the grain;
The breezes, and the sunshine,
And soft refreshing rain.

c
All good gifts around us
Are sent from heaven above:
Then thank the Lord, oh, thank the Lord,
For all His love!

He only is the Maker
Of all things near and far:
He paints the wayside flower;
He lights the evening star;
The winds and waves obey Him;
By Him the birds are fed;
Much more to us, His children,
He gives our daily bread.

We thank Thee, then, O Father,
For all things bright and good:
The seed-time and the harvest,
Our life, our health, our food.
Accept the gifts we offer
For all Thy love imparts;
And—what Thou most desirest—
Our humble, thankful hearts.


1054
Some are sowing their seed in the dawn-light fair

Some are sowing their seed in the dawn-light fair;
They are sowing seed in the noonday glare;
They are sowing seed in the soft twilight;
They are sowing their seed in the solemn night.

c
What shall the harvest be?
What shall the harvest be?
What shall the harvest be?
What shall the harvest be?

Some are sowing their seed of word and deed,
Which the cold know not, nor the careless heed;
Oh, the gentle word, and the kindest deed,
That have blessed the sad heart in its sorest need.

c
Sweet shall the harvest be!

Some are sowing the seed of noble deed,
With a sleepless watch and an earnest heed;
With a ceaseless hand in the earth they sow,
And the fields are all whitening where'er they go.

c
Rich will the harvest be!

Whether sown in the darkness, or sown in the light;
Whether sown in weakness, or sown in might;
Whether sown in meekness, or sown in wrath,
In the broadest highway, or the shadowy path:

c
Sure will the harvest be!


1055
Come, ye thankful people, come

Come, ye thankful people, come,
Raise the song of harvest-home:
All is safely gathered in,
Ere the winter storms begin;
God, our Maker, doth provide
For our wants to be supplied:
Come to God's own temple, come,
Raise the song of harvest-home.

All this world is God's own field,
Fruit unto His praise to yield;
Wheat and tares together sown,
Unto joy or sorrow grown:
First, the blade, and then the ear.
Then the full corn shall appear:
Lord of harvest, grant that we
Wholesome grain and pure may be.

For the Lord our God shall come,
And shall take His harvest-home;
From His field shall in that day
All offences purge away;
Give His angels charge at last,
In the fire the tares to cast;
But the fruitful ears to store,
In His garner evermore.

Even so, Lord, quickly come,
To Thy final harvest-home;
Gather Thou Thy people in,
Free from sorrow, free from sin;
There, for ever purified,
In Thy presence to abide:
Come with all Thine angels, come,
Raise the glorious harvest-home.


1056
With songs and honours sounding

With songs and honours sounding loud
Address the Lord on high;
Over the heavens He spreads His cloud,
And waters veil the sky.
He sends His showers of blessings down,
To cheer the plains below;
He makes the grass the mountains crown,
And corn in valleys grow,

His steady counsels change the face
Of the declining year;
He bids the sun cut short his race,
And wintry days appear.
His hoary frost, His fleecy snow,
Descend and clothe the ground;
The liquid streams forbear to flow,
In icy fetters bound.

He sends His word and melts the snow,
The fields no longer mourn;
He calls the warmer gales to blow,
And bids the spring return.
The changing wind, the flying cloud,loud,
Obey His mighty word:
With songs and honours sounding
Praise ye the Sovereign Lord!


1057
Sowing the seed by the dawn-light fair

Sowing the seed by the dawn-light fair,
Sowing the seed by the noonday glare;
Sowing the seed by the fading light,
Sowing the seed in the solemn night:
Oh, what shall the harvest be?
Oh, what shall the harvest be?

c
Sown ... in the darkness or sown ... in the light,
Sown ... in our weakness or sown ... in our might,
Gathered in time or eternity,
Sure, ah, sure will the harvest be!

Sowing the seed by the wayside high,
Sowing the seed on the rocks to die;
Sowing the seed where the thorns will spoil,
Sowing the seed in the fertile soil:
Oh, what shall the harvest be?

Sowing the seed of a lingering pain,
Sowing the seed of a maddened brain;
Sowing the seed of a tarnished name,
Sowing the seed of eternal shame:
Oh, what shall the harvest be?

Sowing the seed with an aching heart,
Sowing the seed while the tear-drops start;
Sowing in hope till the reapers come,
Gladly to gather the harvest home:
Oh, what shall the harvest be?


1058
We praise Thee, O Lord, for the bountiful harvest

We praise Thee, O Lord, for the bountiful harvest
That now has been gathered and garnered with care;
Rewarding the toil of the sower and reaper,
While all in its blessings may share.

c
For the boun - - - tiful harvest, we praise Thee,
We thank Thee and bless Thee, O Lord:
For the boun tiful harvest, we praise Thee,
and bless Thee, O Lord.

We praise Thee, O Lord, for the bountiful harvest,
We praise Thee for sunshine, the dew, and the rain;
For soft summer breezes so gracefully bending
The bright golden billows of grain.

We praise Thee, O Lord, for Thy wonderful token
That shines as it shone on Thy servants of old,
The pledge and assurance that seedtime and harvest
From earth Thou wilt never withhold.

We bless Thee, O Lord, for Thy wonderful mercies;
And while to Thy glory our voices we raise,
O Thou that regardest the prayers of Thy people,
Accept our thanksgiving and praise.


1059
Sing to the Lord of harvest

Sing to the Lord of harvest,
Sing songs of love and praise;
With joyful hearts and voices
Your hallelujahs raise:
By Him the rolling seasons
In fruitful order move,
Sing to the Lord of harvest
A song of happy love.

By Him the clouds drop fatness,
The deserts bloom and spring,
The hills leap up in gladness,
The valleys laugh and sing:
He filleth with His fulness
All things with large increase;
He crowns the year with goodness,
With plenty and with peace.

Heap on His sacred altar
The gifts His goodness gave,
The golden sheaves of harvest,
The souls He died to save:
Your hearts lay down before Him,
When at His feet ye fall,
And with your lives adore Him,
Who gave His life for all.

To God the gracious Father,
Who made us" very good";
To Christ, who, when we wandered,
Restored us with His blood;
And to the Holy Spirit,
Who doth upon us pour
His blessed dews and sunshine,
Be praise for evermore.


1060
He sendeth the sunshine and rain

He sendeth the sunshine and rain,
He scattereth dew on the flowers;
He maketh the desert to bloom—
His blessings descend as the showers.
Bountiful, merciful, wonderful love!

He causeth the rivers to flow,
The fields now with verdure are clad;
He tempers the wind to His lambs,
The earth with His fulness is glad.

For bounty so royal and free,
For mercies unending and new,
Oh, help us to praise Thee, dear Lord,
And serve Thee in all that we do.


1061
Eternal Father! strong to save

Eternal Father! strong to save,
Whose arm hath bound the restless wave,
Who bidd'st the mighty ocean deep
Its own appointed limits keep:
Oh, hear us when we cry to Thee
For those in peril on the sea!

O Christ, whose voice the waters heard,
And hushed their raging at Thy word,
Who walkedst on the foaming deep,
And calm amid the storm didst sleep:
Oh, hear us when we cry to Thee
For those in peril on the sea!

O Holy Spirit! who didst brood
Upon the waters dark and rude,
And bid their angry tumult cease,
And give, for wild confusion, peace:
Oh, hear us when we cry to Thee
For those in peril on the sea!

O Trinity of love and power!
Our brethren shield in danger's hour;
From rock and tempest, fire and foe,
Protect them wheresoe'er they go;
Thus evermore shall rise to Thee
Glad hymns of praise from land and sea.


1062
Great Ruler of the land and sea

Great Ruler of the land and sea,
Almighty God, we come to Thee;
Able to succour and to save
From perils of the wind and wave.
Keep by Thy mighty hand, oh keep
The dwellers on the homeless deep!

Speak to the shadows of the night,
And turn their darkness into light;
Smooth down the breakers* rising crest,
Say to the billow, "Be at rest!"
Keep by Thy mighty hand, oh keep
The dwellers on the homeless deep!

Soothe the rough ocean's troubled face,
And bid the hurricane give place
To the soft breeze that wafts the bark
Safely alike through light and dark.
Keep by Thy mighty hand, oh keep
The dwellers on the homeless deep!

In storm or battle, with Thine arm
Shield Thou the mariner from harm—
From foes without, from ills within,
From deeds, and words, and thoughts, of sin.
Keep by Thy mighty hand, oh keep
The dwellers on the homeless deep!

O Son of God, in days of ill,
Say to each sorrow, "Peace! be still!"
In hours of weakness be Thou nigh,
Heal Thou the sickness, hear the cry.
Keep by Thy mighty hand, oh keep
The dwellers on the homeless deep!

When hidden is each guiding-star,
Flash out the beacon's light afar;
From mist and rock, and shoal and spray,
Protect the sailor on his way.
Keep by Thy mighty hand, oh keep
The dwellers on the homeless deep!

Defend from the quick lightning's stroke,
And from the iceberg's crushing shock;
Take Thou the helm, and surely guide
The wanderer o'er the wayward tide.
Keep by Thy mighty hand, oh keep
The dwellers on the homeless deep!

Good Pilot of the awful main,
Let us not plead Thy love in vain;
Jesus, draw near with kindly aid,
Say, "It is I; be not afraid!"
Keep by Thy mighty hand, oh keep
The dwellers on the homeless deep!

Light in the darkness, sailor, day is at hand

Light in the darkness, sailor, day is at hand!
See o'er the foaming billows fair Haven's land;
Drear was the voyage, sailor, now almost o'er;
Safe within the lifeboat, sailor, pull for the shore.

c
Pull for the shore? sailor, pull for the shore!
Heed not the rolling waves, but bend to the oar;
Safe in the lifeboat, sailor, cling to self no more!
Leave the poor old stranded wreck, and pull for the shore.

Trust in the lifeboat, sailor; all else will fail:
Stronger the surges dash and fiercer the gale;
Heed not the stormy winds, though loudly they roar;
Watch the" Bright and Morning Star, "and pull for the shore.

Bright gleams the morning, sailor, uplift the eye;
Clouds and darkness disappearing,glory is nigh!
Safe in the lifeboat, sailor, sing ever- more:
"Glory, glory, hallelujah!" Pull for the shore.


1064
Star of peace! to wanderers weary

Star of peace! to wanderers weary,
Bright the beams that smile on me;
Cheer the pilot's vision dreary,
Far, far at sea.

Star of hope! gleam on the billow,
Bless the soul that sighs for Thee;
Bless the sailor's lonely pillow,
Far, far at sea.

Star of faith! when winds are mocking
All his toil, he flies to Thee;
Save him on the billows rocking,
Far, far at sea.

Star divine! oh, safely guide him,
Bring the wanderer home to Thee!
Sore temptations long have tried him,
Far, far at sea.


1065
Fierce and wild the storm is raging

Fierce and wild the storm is raging
Round a helpless bark;
On to doom 'tis swiftly driving,
O'er the waters dark!

c
Joy! . . behold the Sa - viour! .
Joy! . . the message hear! . .
"I'll stand by until the morning;
I've come to save you; do not fear!"
Yes, "I'll stand by until the morning;
I've come to save you; do not fear!" . .

Weary, helpless, hopeless seamen,
Fainting on the deck,
With what joy they hail their saviour,
As he hails the wreck!

On a wild and stormy ocean,
Sinking 'neath the wave,
Souls that perish, heed the message! —
Christ has come to save!

Daring death thy soul to rescue,
He in love has come;
Leave the wreck! and in Him trusting,
Thou shalt reach thy home!


1066
Coming, coming, yes, they are

Coming, coming, yes, they are,
Coming, coming, from afar;
From the wild and scorching desert,
Afric's sons of colour deep;
Jesus' love has drawn and won them,
At the cross they bow and weep.

Coming, coming, yes, they are,
Coming, coming, from afar;
From the fields and crowded cities,
China gathers to His feet;
In His love Shem's gentle children
Now have found a safe retreat.

Coming, coming, yes, they are,
Coming, coming, from afar;
From the Indies and the Ganges,
Steady flows the living stream,
To love's ocean, to His bosom,
Calvary their wondering theme.

Coming, coming, yes, they are,
Coming, coming, from afar;
From the steppes of Russia dreary,
From Slavonia's scattered lands,
They are yielding soul and spirit
Into Jesus' loving hands.

Coming, coming, yes, they are,
Coming, coming, from afar;
From the frozen realms of midnight,
Over many a weary mile,
To exchange their soul's long winter
For the summer of His smile.

Coming, coming, yes, they are,
Coming, coming, from afar;
All to meet in plains of glory,
All to sing His praises sweet;
What a chorus, what a meeting
With the family complete!


1067
God of mercy! God of grace!

God of mercy! God of grace!
Show the brightness of Thy face!
Shine upon us, Saviour, shine;
Fill Thy church with light divine;
And Thy saving health extend
Unto earth's remotest end.

Let the people praise Thee, Lord!
Be by all that live adored:
Let the nations shout and sing,
Gtory to their Saviour King!
At Thy feet their tribute pay,
And Thy holy will obey.

Let the people praise Thee, Lord!
Earth shall then her fruits afford;
God to man His blessing give;
Man to God devoted live;====
All below, and all above,
One in joy, and light, and love.


1068
O'er the gloomy hills of darkness

O'er the gloomy hills of darkness,
Look, my soul, be still, and gaze;
All the promises do travail
With a glorious day of grace:
Blessed jubilee,
Let Thy glorious morning dawn!

Let the Indian, let the negro,
Let the rude barbarian see
That divine and glorious conquest
Once obtained on Calvary;
Let the gospel
Loud resound from pole to pole.

Kingdoms wide that sit in darkness,
Grant them, Lord, the saving light,
And from eastern coast to western
May the morning chase the night,
And redemption,
Freely purchased, win the day.

May the glorious day approaching,
On their grossest darkness dawn,
And the everlasting gospel
Spread abroad Thy holy name,
O'er the borders
Of the great Immanuel's land.

Fly abroad, thou mighty gospel,
Win and conquer, never cease;
May thy lasting, wide dominions
Multiply, and still increase:
Sway Thy sceptre,
Saviour, all the world around.

Every creature, living, breathing,
In divinely grateful lays,
Father, Son, and Spirit, praising,
Magnify the God of grace:
Hallelujah!
Fill the universe with praise.


1069
Speed Thy servants, Saviour, speed them

Speed Thy servants, Saviour, speed them:
Thou art Lord of winds and waves;
They were bound, but Thou hast freed them;
Nowthey go to free the slaves
Be Thou with them,
'Tis Thine arm alone that saves.

Friends and home and all forsaking,
Lord, they go at Thy command;
As their stay Thy promise taking,
While they traverse sea and land:
Oh, be with them,
Lead them safely by the hand!

Where no fruit appears to cheer them,
And they seem to toil in vain—
Then in mercy, Lord, draw near them,
Then their sinking hopes sustain;
Thus supported,
Let their zeal revive again.

In the midst of opposition
Let them trust, O Lord, in Thee;
When success attends their mission,
Let Thy servants humble be:
Never leave them,
Till Thy face in heaven they see;

There to reap in joy for ever,
Fruit that grows from seed here sown;
There to be with Him, who never
Ceases to preserve His own,
And with triumph
Sing a Saviour's grace alone.

From Greenland's icy mountains

From Greenland's icy mountains,
From India's coral strand,
Where Afric's sunny fountains
Roll down their golden sand,—
From many an ancient river,
From many a palmy plain—
They call us to deliver
Their land from error's chain.

What though the spicy breezes
Blow soft o'er Ceylon's isle;
Though every prospect pleases,
And only man is vile:
In vain with lavish kindness
The gifts of God are strown;
The heathen, in his blindness,
Bows down to wood and stone.

Shall we, whose souls are lighted
With wisdom from on high —
Shall we, to men benighted,
The lamp of life deny?
Salvation! oh, salvation!
The joyful sound proclaim,
Till earth's remotest nation
Has learned Messiah's name.

Waft, waft, ye winds, His story,
And you, ye waters, roll,
Till, like a sea of glory,
It spreads from pole to pole;
Till o'er our ransomed nature
The Lamb for sinners slain,
Redeemer, King, Creator,
In bliss returns to reign!

The morning light is breaking

The morning light is breaking;
The darkness disappears!
The sons of earth are waking
To penitential tears;
Each breeze that sweeps the ocean
Brings tidings from afar,
Of nations in commotion,
Prepared for Zion's war.

See heathen nations bending
Before the God we love,
And thousand hearts ascending
In gratitude above;
While sinners, now confessing,
The gospel call obey,
And seek the Saviour's blessing—
A nation in a day.

Blest river of salvation!
Pursue thine onward way;
Flow thou to every nation,
Nor in thy richness stay:
Stay not till all the lowly
Triumphant reach their home:
Stay not till all the holy
Proclaim—" The Lord is come!"


1072
Speed away! speed away on your mission of light

Speed away! speed away on your mission of light,
To the lands that are lying in darkness and night;
'Tis the Master's command; go ye forth in His name,
The wonderful Gospel of Jesus proclaim.
Take your lives in your hand, to the work while 'tis day,
Speed away! speed away! speed away!

Speed away! speed away with the life-giving Word,
To the nations that know not the voice of the Lord;
Take the wings of the morning and fly o'er the wave,
In the strength of your Master the lost ones to save.
He is calling once more—not a moment's delay!
Speed away! speed away! speed away!

Speed away! speed away with the message of rest,
To the souls by the tempter in bondage opprest;
For the Saviour has purchased their ransom from sin,
And the banquet is ready: oh, gather them in!
To the rescue make haste, there's no time for delay
Speed away! speed away! speed away!


1073

That the mighty King of Glory is the King of Peace;
Tell it out with jubilation, let the song ne'er cease;
Tell it out! Tell it out!

Tell it out among the people that the Saviour reigns;
Tell it out! Tell it out!
Tell it out among the heathen, bid them break their chains;
Tell it out! Tell it out!
Tell it out among the weeping ones that Jesus lives,
Tell it out among the weary ones what rest He gives;
Tell it out among the sinners that He came to save;
Tell it out! Tell it out!

Tell it out among the people, Jesus reigns above;
Tell it out! Tell it out!
Tell it out among the nations, that His reign is love;
Tell it out! Tell it out!
Tell it out among the highways and the lanes at home,
Let it ring across the mountains and the ocean's foam,
That the weary, heavy-laden, need no longer roam;
Tell it out! Tell it out!


1074
Eternal Father, Thou hast said

Eternal Father, Thou hast said
That Christ all glory shall obtain;
That He who once a sufferer bled
Shall o'er the world a conqueror reign.

We wait Thy triumph, Saviour-King;
Long ages have prepared Thy way;
Now all abroad Thy banners fling,
Set time's great battle in array.

Thy hosts are mustered to the field;
"The Cross! the Cross!" the battle-call:
The old grim towers of darkness yield,
And soon shall totter to their fall.

On mountain-tops the watch-fires glow,
Where scattered wide the watch men stand;
Voice echoes voice, and onward flow
The joyous shouts from land to land.

Oh, fill the Church with faith and power!
Bid her long night of weeping cease;
To groaning nations haste the hour
Oflife and freedom, light and peace.


1075
Ye Christian heralds, go proclaim

Ye Christian heralds, go proclaim
Salvation through Immanuels name;
To distant climes the tidings bear,
And plant the Rose of Sharon there.

He'll shield you with a wall of fire,
With flaming zeal your heart inspire;
Bid raging winds their fury cease,
And hush the tempest into peace.

And when our labours all are o'er,
Then we shall meet to part no more,
With all the ransomed hosts to fall,
And crown our Saviour Lord of all.


1076
O Church of Christ, behold at last

O Church of Christ, behold at last
The promised sign appear!
The Gospel preached in all the world,
And lo! the King draws near.

c
He shall reign from sea to sea,
When He girds on His conquering sword;
All the ends of the earth shall see
The salvation of our God.

With girded loins, make haste, make haste,
Thy witness to complete,
That Christ may take His throne and bring
All nations to His feet.

And Thou, O Israel, long in dust,
Arise, and come away!
See how the Sun of Righteousness
Sheds forth the beams of day.

The scattered sons are gathering home,
The fig tree buds again;
A little while, and David's Son
On David's throne shall reign.

Then sing aloud, O Pilgrim Church,
Brief conflict yet remains,
And then Immanuel descends
To bind thy foe in chains!

Saved to serve our glorious King;

From the deadly power of sin;

Out of darkness into light.

Over mountain, over wave,
Telling everywhere of Jesus,
And His mighty power to save.

While we pray for other nations,
Send them help with willing hand;
Let us not forget the home-fields —
Jesus for our native land!

Echo back, ye ocean caves;
Earth shall keep her jubilee:
Jesus saves! Jesus saves!

Sing above the toil and strife —
Jesus saves! Jesus saves!
By His death and endless life —
Jesus saves! Jesus saves!
Sing it softly through the gloom,
When the heart for mercy craves;
Sing in triumph o'er the tomb —
Jesus saves! Jesus saves!

Give the winds a mighty voice:
Jesus saves! Jesus saves!
Let the nations now rejoice —
Jesus saves I Jesus saves!
Shout salvation full and free
To every strand that ocean laves;
This our song of victory,
Jesus saves! Jesus saves!

Sowing the precious seed in the early dawn of morning

Sowing the precious seed in the early dawn of morning,
Sowing the precious seed in the noonday fair;
Sowing the precious seed, for the youthful heart's adorning,
Sowing the precious seed with a patient care.

c
Sowing the precious seed, sowing the precious seed,
Scattering far and wide, with patient loving hand;
Breaking the bread of life,
Telling o'er the Gospel story,
Sowing the precious seed in the dear homeland.

Sowing the precious seed at the early day's declining,
Sowing the precious seed in the twilight dim;
Sowing the precious seed, neither doubting nor repining,
Leaving it all to God, trusting all to Him.

Sowing the precious seed with an earnest, true endeavour,
Sowing the precious seed of the golden grain;
Sowing the precious seed, and the hand withholding never,
Praying that God will send it the sun and rain.

The glad, glad sound;

Distant climes His triumph singing.

Praise the Father, praise the Son,

Through eternal ages ringing,
Ransomed ones shall still proclaim,

Great Jehovah, mighty Lord

Vast and boundless is Thy word;
King of kings, from shore to shore
Thou shalt reign for evermore.

Jew and Gentile, bond and free,
All shall yet be one in Thee;
All confess Messiah's name,
All His wondrous love proclaim.

From her night shall China wake;
Afric's sons their chains shall break;
Egypt, where Thy people trod,
Shall adore and praise our God.

India's groves of palm so fair
Shall resound with praise and prayer;
Ceylon's isle with joy shall sing,
"Glory be to Christ our King!"

East and West Thy voice obey;
Crowns and thrones before Thee fall,
King of kings, and Lord of all.

Doth his successive journeys run;

Their early blessings on His Name.

To Him shall endless prayer be made,
And endless praises crown His head;
His name like sweet perfume shall rise
With every morning sacrifice.

Peculiar honours to its King;
Angels descend with songs again,
And earth repeat the loud Amen.

Through a dear Redeemer's name.

Love is boundless, grace is free!

In their darkness, gloom, and night;
Haste, oh, haste! the days are fleeting.
And the hours—how swift their flight!

To His Holy Word attend:
"Go ye forth and preach My gospel;
Lo! I'm with you to the end."

With the waves of ripened grain;
Far and near their gold is gleaming
O'er the sunny slope and plain.

Lord, we pray Thee, send forth reapers!
Hear us, while to Thee we cry;
Send them now the sheaves to gather,
Ere the harvest-time pass

Send them forth with morn's first beaming,
Send them in the noontide's glare;
When the sun's last rays are gleaming.
Bid them gather everywhere.

Hasten now, the grain is bending,
Gather now the sheaves of gold;
Homeward then at evening wending,
Thou shalt come with joy untold.

Hasten, Lord, the glorious time

Hasten, Lord, the glorious time
When, beneath Messiah's sway,
Every nation, every clime,
Shall the Gospel's call obey.

Mightiest kings His power shall own,
Heathen tribes His name adore;

Bound in chains, shall hurt no more.

Then shall wars and tumults cease,
Then be banished grief and pain;
Righteousness, and joy, and peace,
Undisturbed shall ever reign.

Bless we, then, our gracious Lord!
Ever praise His glorious name!
All His mighty acts record;
Ail His wondrous love proclaim.

Before Thy face, great King, we stand;

The truth for which the martyrs bled;
Along the line, to either pole,
The thunder of Thy praise to roll.

The single eye, the faithful heart.

Recall the wandering spirits home;
From Zion's mount send forth the sound,
To spread the spacious earth around.

With trumpet voice proclaim
To all a full salvation,
Through Christ the Saviour's name.

That Star divinely bright,
Shall bear to every nation
The blessed gospel light:
All kingdoms, crowns, and sceptres,
Before the Cross shall fall,
And Christ shall reign triumphant,
The King and Lord of all

And dream no more, nor wander, your calling high attain.

With joy your Master serving, for you He bled and died.

Till, with the Church triumphant, I sing His praise above!

He brought me out of bondage, He paid my debt of sin;
The door of Life He opened, that I might enter in.

He left His home in glory, He laid His sceptre down,
And on the cross He suffered, that I might wear a crown.

Be this my one Endeavour, to glorify His name;
The story of Redemption to all the world proclaim.

In a world where sorrow ever will be known

In a world where sorrow ever will be known,
Where are found the needy, and the sad and lone;
How much joy and comfort you can all bestow,
If you scatter sunshine everywhere you go!

c
Scat---ter sunshine all along your way,
Cheer and bless and brighten every passing day.

Slightest actions often meet the sorest needs,
For the world wants daily little kindly deeds;
Oh, what care and sorrow you may help remove,
With your songs and courage, sympathy and love.

When the days are gloomy, sing some happy song;
Meet the world's repining with a courage strong;
Go with faith undaunted through the ills of life,
Scatter smiles and sunshine o'er its toil and strife.


1108
With cheerful songs and hymns of praise

With cheerful songs and hymns of praise,
Our grateful hearts to Him we raise
Who leads us on with gentle hand,
And crowns with love our Christian Band.

c
Then gladly let us stand, united heart and hand,
The lost to gather in from sorrow, pain, and sin;
Be this our constant aim—to spread abroad the name
Of Jesus our Redeemer, and His wondrous love proclaim.

And while we meet together here,
In bonds of love and friendship dear,
Oh, may our prayers like incense rise,
To Him whose grace each need supplies.

O Thou, who art the children's Friend,
Our steps direct, our paths defend,
And by Thine own almighty hand,
Protect and keep our Christian Band.


1109
Oh, let us all endeavour, with all our heart and might

Oh, let us all endeavour, with all our heart and might,
To serve our Lord and Master, and in His work delight;
Remembering that service must come before reward;
That joy must flow from doing the Father's will and word.

c
For Christ . . and the Church . . our all, O Lord, we give!
For Christ . . . and the Church, . . oh, may we ever live!

Oh, let us all endeavour the world for Christ to win;
To search the streets and highways for souls to save from sin;
To send the blessed tidings to all the world around,
Till every race and nation shall hear the joyful sound.

Oh, let us all endeavour the Church of Christ to build,
Be faithful in its service, our all for it to yield;
Its ordinances follow, its means of grace attend;
Thus grow in Christlike power until our life shall end.


1110
"Our land for Christ" we sing

"Our land for Christ" we sing;
Our hearts to Him we bring,
And trust His word;
With His dear cross in view,
Each Christian grace renew,
And make endeavour true,
For Christ our Lord.

c
Our land for Christ, our hearts we bring.
And make endeavour firm and true
For Christ, our Lord and King.

"Our land for Christ" we sing;
Away earth's follies fling,
And seek His love;
Ours be a heavenly prize,
Unseen by mortal eyes,
In mansions in the skies,
With Him above.

"Our land for Christ" we sing;
Christ, Prophet, Priest, and King,
Whom saints adore;
Each day some duty done,
Some Christian work begun,
Some soul to Jesus won—
We ask no more.

"Our land for Christ" we sing;
Our all to Him we bring
With one accord;
Sinners, from sin set free,
His wondrous grace shall see,
And through eternity
Worship the Lord.

Now just a word for Jesus, your dearest Friend so true

Now just a word for Jesus, your dearest Friend so true;
Come, cheer our hearts and tell us what He hath done for you.

c
Now just a word for Jesus, 'twill help us on our way!
One little word for Jesus, oh speak, or sing, or pray!

Now just a word for Jesus; you feel your sins forgiven,
And by His grace are striving to reach a home in heaven.

Now just a word for Jesus; a cross it cannot be
To say, "I love my Saviour, who gave His life for me."

Now just a word for Jesus; let not the time be lost;
The heart's neglected duty brings sorrow, to its cost.

Now just a word for Jesus; and if your faith be dim,
Arise in all your weakness, and leave the rest to Him.


1112
Let us work and pray together

Let us work and pray together,
With a firm and strong endeavour;
Hearts and hands united ever
In the service of the Lord:
In His constant love abiding,
And to Him our all confiding,
With His gentle hand still guiding,
We shall conquer through His word.

In the dawn of life's fair morning,
With its smile our path adorning,
Let us heed the Master's warning:
"Time is flying; work to-day!"
See the royal host advancing:
Armed with zeal, and upward glancing,
Full of hope and joy entrancing,
Let us quickly haste away.

Come and join the ranks before us;
Hark! their songs are floating o'er us;
Hear the glad and tuneful chorus,
How it vibrates on the air!
Home is near, and toil is ending,
Soon the mount of joy ascending,
Where the blest their harps are blending,
We shall meet our loved ones there.


1113
Praise ye the Lord! lift up the voice with singing

Tell to the world the glory of His name;
Join in the song while joyful notes are ringing
Far o'er the earth: oh spread abroad His fame!

c
Yes, we'll tell the wondrous story,
We will laud His holy name;
And will give our best endeavour
Still to spread abroad His fame.

Praise ye the Lord, with holy adoration!
Worthy is He of all our love and praise;
Look unto Him, the Rock of our Salvation;
His gracious hand hath led us all our days.

Praise ye the Lord, and worship Him with gladness!
Thanks to His name for all His wondrous love;
Praise ye the Lord! let praises banish sadness
Now and for ever till we meet above.

Our willing service, Lord, to Thee

Our willing service, Lord, to Thee
We pledge ourselves to give,
For Thou hast bought us with Thy blood,
And died that we might live;
We pledge ourselves by grace to yield
Obedience to Thy laws,
Devotion to Thy sacred truth,
Thy kingdom and Thy cause.

We pledge ourselves with filial love
To follow Thy commands,
To help the Church by word and deed,
And aid our pastor's hands;
Be this our one supreme desire,
Our purpose, thought, and aim,
In whatsoever we shall do,
To glorify Thy name.

And so we pledge ourselves to walk,
That those around may see
The calm reflection of a light
That only shines from Thee;
O help us, Lord, our pledge to keep;
We need Thy constant care
To guard our hearts from every sin,
Our feet from every snare. —

The call of God is sounding clear

The call of God is sounding clear,
O Christian, let it reach thine ear;
Endeavour now of souls to bring
A band to love and serve the King.

c
Let us go forth! . . . the call is clear; . . .
Let us go forth, ... no tarrying here! . . .
For Him to live, . . . the Christ, the Lord, . . .
A crown from Him . . . our high reward.

Let us go forth, as called of God,
Redeemed by Jesus' precious blood;
His love to show, His life to live.
His message speak, His mercy give.

Let" Christ alone!" our watchword be—
The Son of God who made us free;
He bore our sins, He makes us pure,
For His name's sake we all endure.

The Christ of God to glorify,
His grace in us to magnify;
His word of life to all make known—
Be this our work, and this alone.

Go on your way rejoicing, ye children of the King

Go on your way rejoicing, ye children of the King;
In songs of holy rapture, His glorious triumph sing.

c
Go on your way rejoicing, and to the world proclaim!
Behold, Messiah bringeth redemption thro' His name.

Go on your way rejoicing, to brave the host of sin;
From bondage and oppression immortal souls to win.

Go on your way rejoicing; the victory draweth near;
For He, your great Commander, in clouds will soon appear.


1117
Are we walking, daily walking ,

Are we walking, daily walking,
as the children of the light,
Casting off the works of darkness,
and the shadows of the night?
Have we left them for the sunshine
freely streaming from above,
For the clear and blessed sunshine
of the Saviour's wondrous love?

c
Are we walk---ing in His sight ...
as the chil---dren of the light? . . .
In the precious blood of Jesus
have we made our garments white?
Are we marching on to glory
as the children of the light?


Are we walking, humbly walking,
as the children of the light,
In a world of pain and sorrow,
where the powers of sin unite?
Are we seeking souls that wander
in the dark and downward way?
Do we win them to the radiance of
the everlasting day?

Let our songs ring out in gladness,
as the children of the light,
Let the joy of His salvation make our
hearts and faces bright;
Then, oh then, will sinners listen to
the message that we bring,
And with us will follow Jesus to the
city of the King.

Lonely hearts to comfort, weary lives to cheer

Lonely hearts to comfort, weary lives to cheer —
This is our Endeavour, this our mission here;
Seeking out the lost ones on the mountains cold,
We would gladly bring them to the Shepherd's fold.

Pressing on together, doing good to all,
In the name of Jesus lifting those who fall;
To the poor and friendless give with open hand—
This is our Endeavour, this the Lord's command.

Onward, ever onward, trusting in the Lord,
Look we for the promise of a blest reward;
Robes and palms of glory, mansions bright and fair,
Welcome from the Saviour, rest for ever there.

Our lips His praise to speak,
Our hands to help the weak;
Our feet the lost to seek,
"For Christ . . and the Church."

Uni - - ted heart and hand;

And glad hosannas bring;
Since He hath made us free,
And promised victory,
Our motto still shall be,

1120
The prize is set before us

The prize is set before us;
To win, His words implore us:
The eye of God is o'er us,
From on high! . . .
His loving tones are calling,
While sin is dark, appalling;
'Tis Jesus gently calling:
He is nigh! . . .

c
By and by we shall meet Him,
By and by we shall greet Him,
And with Jesus reign in glory,
By and by! . . .

We'll follow where He leadeth,
We'll pasture where He feedeth,
We'll yield to Him who pleadeth
From on high! . . .
Then naught from Him shall sever,
Our hope shall brighten ever,
And faith shall fail us never:
He is nigh! . . .

Our home is bright above us,
No trials dark to move us,
But Jesus dear to love us
There on high! . . .
We'll give our best endeavour,
And praise His name for ever:
His precious words can never,
Never die! . . .

A little pilgrim on life's way

A little pilgrim on life's way,
Bearing his cross from day to day,
When faint and weary, used to say,
"Jesus, my Saviour!"

If Satan tempted him aside,
He never on himself relied,
But grasped the shield of faith and cried,
"Jesus, my Saviour!"

And looking up from what he feared,
Though far away his rest appeared,
Oh, how the thought his spirit cheered,
"Jesus, my Saviour!"

Thus, Lord, direct my youthful way,
Thyself to love, Thy law obey;
Then shall I praise through endless day
"Jesus, my Saviour!"


1122
We're banded together in Christian Endeavour

We're banded together in Christian Endeavour,
To live for the Master and serve Him for ever;
To follow His standard, His counsel obeying;
To care for the poor, and to seek for the straying.

c
"For Christ . . . and the Church"...
we are band---ed together; . . .
"For Christ . . and the Church"...
is our watchword, our watchword for ever.

In Jesus our Saviour, believing, abiding,
Our all to His goodness and mercy confiding;
We'll scatter bright sunshine o'er paths that are dreary,
And tell of His love to the hearts that are weary.

Thus banded together in Christian Endeavour,
The bonds that unite us the world cannot sever;
Upheld by the Master, and kindly defended,
We'll work for His cause till life's mission is ended.


1123
Our Junior Band is marching on

Our Junior Band is marching on,
With banners waving o'er us,
To work for Christ, whose loving hand
Directs the way before us.

c
Wave, wave our banners,
While forward marching here below
Wave, wave our banners,
While onward still we go.

While gladly pressing on our way,
The path of faith pursuing,
We know that He, in whom we trust,
Our strength is still renewing.

We'll never fear, though trials come,
For this is our Endeavour:
With cheerful hearts and willing hands
To work and weary never.

Oh, come and join our Junior Band,
The lost to Jesus bringing;
Still doing all the good we can,
While time its flight is winging.

Shining for Jesus everywhere I go;

Shining for Jesus everywhere I go;
Shining for Jesus in this world of woe;
Shining for Jesus, more like Him I grow:
Shining all the time for Jesus.

c
Shining all the time, shining all the time;
Shining for Jesus, beams of love divine;
Glorifying Him every day and hour.
Shining all the time for Jesus.

Shining for Jesus when the way is bright;
Shining for Jesus in the darkest night:
Shining for Jesus, making burdens light:
Shining all the time for Jesus.

Shining for Jesus in a world of sin;
Shining for Jesus, bringing lost ones in;
Shining for Jesus, glorifying Him:
Shining all the time for Jesus.

Shining for Jesus when He gives me grace;
Shining for Jesus while I run the race;
Shining for Jesus, till I see His face:
Shining all the time for Jesus.


1125
O Christ, I will endeavour

O Christ, I will endeavour
To serve Thee day by day;
Help me to make Thee ever
My Life, my Truth, my Way.
When in my breast Thou burnest,
My thoughts grow pure and bright,
My words are calm and earnest,
And all seems good and right.

Go with me, God my Saviour,
Go with me every hour;
Control my whole behaviour
By Thy full Spirit's power;
Uplift, and heal, and gladden,
Myself and others, Lord;
May naught that's in me sadden
Those here that love Thy word.

Why should I not be willing
To serve Thee with my days,
When Thou art ever filling
My soul with joy and praise?
Why should I not show others
The Light Divine in Thee?
Why should not all my brothers
See what Thou art to me?


1126
We meet again with hearts aflame

We meet again with hearts aflame,
To praise the dear Redeemer's name,
With voices full of love and song:
Behold a happy throng!

c
Then shout aloud, while hills around
Re-echo with a joyful sound:
"Let Christ be King! let Christ be King!
To Him our praise we bring."

We thank our Saviour and our Lord
For all the sweetness of His word—
The Cross at which we laid our sin,
The crown we hope to win.

O teach us, Lord, in this glad hour,
The greatness of Thy Spirit's power;
Reign Thou supreme in every heart—
The King of Love Thou art.

Be with us in our every home,
Be with us in the days to come;
May" Saved to Serve" our motto be,
While working still for Thee.


1127
Joy-bells ringing, children singing

Joy-bells ringing, children singing,
Fill the air with music sweet;
Joyful measure, guileless pleasure,
Make the chain of song complete.

c
Joy-bells! Joy-bells!
Never, never cease your ringing!
Children! Children!
Never, never cease your singing!
Hymns for Young People
List, list, the song that swells—
Joy-bells! Joy-bells!

Joy-bells ringing, children singing,
Hark their voices loud and clear,
Breaking o'er us, like a chorus,
From a purer, happier sphere.

Earth seems brighter, hearts grow lighter,
As the gladsome melody
Charms our sadness into gladness,
Pealing, pealing joyfully.

Joy-bells nearer sound, and clearer,
When the heart is free from care;
Skies are cheering, and we're hearing
Joy-bells ringing everywhere.


1128
Go thou in life's fair morning

Go thou in life's fair morning,
Go in the bloom of youth;
And buy, for thine adorning,
The precious pearl of truth:
Secure this heavenly treasure,
And bind it on thine heart,
And let not earthly pleasure
E'er cause it to depart.

Go, while the day-star shineth,
Go, while thy heart is light;
Go, ere thy strength declineth,
While every sense is bright:
Sell all thou hast, and buy it;
Tis worth all earthly things—
Rubies, and gold, and diamonds,
Sceptres and crowns of kings.

Go, ere the clouds of sorrow
Steal o'er the bloom of youth;
Defer not till to-morrow,
Go now, and buy the truth,—
Go, seek thy great Creator,
Learn early to be wise;
Go, place upon His altar
A morning sacrifice.


1129
Jesus wants me for a sunbeam

Jesus wants me for a sunbeam,
To shine for Him each day;
In every way try to please Him—
At hime, at school, at play.

c
A sunbeam, a sunbeam,
Jesus wants me for a sunbeam
A sunbeam, a sunbeam—
I'll be a sunbeam for Him.

Jesus wants me to be loving,
And kind to all I see;
Showing how pleasant and happy
His little one can be.

I will ask Jesus to help me,
To keep my heart from sin;
Ever reflecting His goodness,
And always shine for Him.

I'll be a sunbeam for Jesus —
I can if I but try —
Serving Him moment by moment,
Then live with Him on High


1130
There's a Friend for little children

There's a Friend for little children,
Above the bright blue sky;
A Friend who never changeth,
Whose love can never die.
Unlike our friends by nature,
Who change with changing years,
This Friend is always worthy,
The precious name He bears.

There's a rest for little children,
Above the bright blue sky;
Who love the blessed Saviour,
And" Abba, Father, "cry;
A rest from every turmoil,
From sin and danger free;
Where every little pilgrim
Shall rest eternally.

There's a home for little children,
Above the bright blue sky;
Where Jesus reigns in glory,
A home of peace and joy.
No home on earth is like it,
Nor can with it compare:
For every one is happy,
Nor could be happier, there.

There's a crown for little children,
Above the bright blue sky;
And all who look for Jesus
Shall wear it by and by—
A crown of brightest glory,
Which He will then bestow
On all who've found His favour
And loved His name below.

There's a song for little children,
Above the bright blue sky —
A song that will not weary,
Though sung continually;
A song which even angels
Can never, never sing;
They know not Christ as Saviour,
But worship Him as King.

There's a robe for little children,
Above the bright blue sky;
And a harp of sweetest music,
And a palm of victory,
All, all above is treasured,
And found in Christ alone;
Oh, come, dear little children,
That all may be your own.


1131
Tell me the Old, Old Story

Tell me the Old, Old Story
Of unseen things above,
Of Jesus and His glory,
Of Jesus and His love.
Tell me the Story simply,
As to a little child,
For I am weak and weary,
And helpless and defiled

c
Tell me the Old, Old Story
Of Jesus and His love.

Tell me the Story slowly,
That I may take it in—
That wonderful redemption,
God's remedy for sin.
Tell me the Story often,
For I forget so soon;
The" early dew" of morning
Has passed away at noon.

Tell me the Story softly,
With earnest tones and grave;
Remember! I'm the sinner
Whom Jesus came to save.
Tell me that Story always,
If you would really be,
In any time of trouble,
A comforter to me.

Tell me the same Old Story,
When you have cause to fear
That this world's empty glory
Is costing me too dear.
Yes, and when that world's glory
Is dawning on my soul,
Tell me the Old, Old Story:
"Christ Jesus makes thee whole."


1132
Little children may be heralds of the great salvation

Little children may be heralds of the great salvation,
They may tell of our Redeemer and the cross He bore;
By their grateful Sabbath offerings they can send the Bible,
That will cheer the hearts of many on a far-off shore.

c
Lit - - tle chil - dren . may . . be heralds,
Joyful heralds of the blessed Saviour's love;
Lit - - tle chil - dren . may . . be heralds,
Gladly pointing many to the home above.

Little children have their mission in the Master's service,
They can smile away the sorrows and the clouds of care;
O'er the worn and weary spirit, that with grief is pining,
They can drop a word of kindness like a sunbeam fair.

Little children are remembered in the Saviour's promise,
They may early share the blessings of redeeming grace;
He is watching kindly o'er them, and His word assures us
That in heaven their angels ever see the Father's face.


1133
Never lose the golden rule, keep it still in view

Never lose the golden rule, keep it still in view;
Do to others as you would they should do to you.
Kindly, gently, in their burden bear a part,
Meekly chiding with a loving heart

c
Never lose the golden rule, keep it still in view;
Do to others as you would they should do to you.

Help the feeble ones along, cheer the faint and weak;
To the sorrow-laden heart words of comfort speak.
Freely, freely, from the bounty of your store,
Cheerful givers, help the humbler poor.

Love the Lord, the first command, with thy soul and mind;
Love thy neighbour as thyself, both in one combined.
Justly, justly, with each other strive to live
Ever ready, willing to forgive.


1134
There is a green hill far away

There is a green hill far away,
Without a city wall,
Where the dear Lord was crucified,
Who died to save us all.

We may not know, we cannot tell,
What pains He had to bear;
But we believe it was for us
He hung and suffered there.

He died that we might be forgiven,
He died to make us good,
That we might go at last to heaven,
Saved by His precious blood.

There was no other good enough
To pay the price of sin;
He only could unlock the gate
Of heaven, and let us in.

Oh, dearly, dearly has He loved!
And we must love Him too;
And trust in His redeeming blood,
And try His works to do.


1135
How can we forget Him, our blessed Redeemer

How can we forget Him, our blessed Redeemer?
How can we forget Him, and wander away,
When He like a Shepherd so carefully guards us,
And keeps us from danger by night and by day?

c
We'll come in the sunshine of youth's happy morning,
Our lives to His service we'll cheerfully give;
And pray for His Spirit to guide and direct us,
That we to His glory and honour may live.

How can we forget Him, our blessed Redeemer;
Who hath brought redemption through sorrow and pain?
Yet upon the throne of His Father exalted,
Our great Mediator now liveth again.

How can we forget Him, our blessed Redeemer,
Who with watchful kindness is ever so near—
Friend, above all others the best and the truest,
Who never refuseth His child hear?


1136
I think when I read that sweet story of old

I think when I read that sweet story of old,
When Jesus was here among men,
How He called little children as lambs to His fold:
I should like to have been with them then.

I wish that His hands had been placed on my head,
That His arms had been thrown around me,
And that I might have seen His kind look when He said,
"Let the little ones come unto Me."

Yet still to His footstool in prayer I may go,
And ask for a share in His love;
And if I now earnesly seek Him below,
I shall see Him and hear Him above,
In that beautiful place He is gone to prepare,
For all who are washed and forgiven;
And many dear children are gathering there,
"For of such is the kingdom of heaven."

But thousands and thousands who wander and fall,
Never heard of that heavenly home:
I should like them to know there is room for them all,
And that Jesus has bid them to come.
I long for the joy of that glorious time,
The sweetest, and brightest, and best,
When the dear little children of every clime
Shall crowd to His arms and be blest.


1137
Far above in highest heaven

Far above in highest heaven
Jesus reigns, our Lord and King;
He His life for us has given,
He did life eternal bring:
Sing, then, children, sing with gladness,
Loud let grateful anthems ring;
Jesus is the children's Saviour,
Jesus is the children's King.

Once on earth the children praised Him,
And" Hosanna" was their cry;
Now that God to heaven has raised Him,
Loud they praise Him in the sky:
Shout, then, children, shout your praises,
Loud let grateful anthems ring;
Jesus is the children's Saviour,
Jesus is the children's King.

Come, then, early, come to Jesus,
As the children did of old:
He from sin and sorrow frees us,
Never will His love grow cold:
Daily let us learn to love Him,
Daily let us join to sing
Praises to our Lord and Saviour,
Praises to the children's King.

Then, when life's short days are ended,
If we've served our Saviour well,
By His angels gently tended,
In His kingdom we shall dwell:
There we'll shout our joyous praises,
There the song of victory sing;
Jesus is our Lord and Saviour,
Jesus is the children's King.


1138
Jesus bids us shine with a clear, pure light

Jesus bids us shine with a clear, pure light,
Like a little candle burning in the night;
In this world of darkness we must shine—
You in your small corner, and I in mine.

Jesus bids us shine, first of all for Him;
Well He sees and knows it, if our light is dim;
He looks down from heaven, to see us shine—
You in your small corner, and I in mine.

Jesus bids us shine, then; for, all around,
Many kinds of darkness in this world abound:
Sin and want and sorrow; so we must shine—
You in your small corner, and I in mine.


1139
We are but little children weak

We are but little children weak,
Nor born in any high estate;
What can we do for Jesus' sake,
Who is so high, and good, and great?

Oh, day by day each Christian child
Has much to do, without, within;
A death to die for Jesus' sake,
A weary war to wage with sin.

When deep within our swelling hearts
The thoughts of pride and anger rise;
When bitter words are on our tongues,
And tears of passion in our eyes:

Then we may stay the angry blow,
Then we may check the hasty word;
Give gentle answers back again,
And fight a battle for our Lord.

With smiles of peace and looks of love
Light in our dwellings we may make;
Bid kind good humour brighten there—
And still do all for Jesus' sake.

There's not a child so small and weak
But has his little cross to take,
His little work of love and praise
That he may do for Jesus' sake.


1140
When He cometh, when He cometh

When He cometh, when He cometh.
To make up His jewels,
All His jewels, precious jewels.
His loved and His own.

c
Like the stars of the morning,
His bright crown adorning,
They shall shine in their beauty,
Bright gems for His crown.

He will gather, He will gather,
The gems for His kingdom;
All the pure ones, all the bright ones,
His loved and His own.

Little children, little children,
Who love their Redeemer,
Are the jewels, precious jewels,
His loved and His own.


1141
Come with happy faces—

Come with happy faces
To the place of prayer;
Jesus now is waiting,
We shall find Him there.

c
With a grateful spirit,
Now our voices raise;
Thank Him for His goodness
In a song of praise.

Come with happy faces—
Jesus rose to-day;
Leave the world behind us,
Seek the narrow way.

Come with happy faces,
Come with hearts sincere;
God our thoughts is reading,
He is ever near.

Come with happy faces,
Learn the words of truth;
Jesus loves the children:
Trust Him in our youth.

Of Him who left His home above

Of Him who left His home above,
Children sing! Children sing!
Our blessed Saviour crowned with love,
Children sing to-day!
Of Him whose ever-watchful care
Will guard our feet from every snare,
Who loves to hear our earnest prayer,
Children sing to-day!

Of joy and gladness through His name,
Children sing! Children sing!
And peace to all the world proclaim,
Children sing to-day!
Redemption now from death and sin,
From foes without and foes within,
Of life eternal all may win,
Children sing to-day!

Of Him who did salvation bring,
Children sing! Children sing!
He is our Shepherd, Priest, and King,
Children sing to-day!
Of loved ones in the heavenly land,
Who ever in His presence stand,
With yonder shining angel band,
Children sing to-day!


1143
God make my life a little light

God make my life a little light
Within the world to glow;
A little flame that burneth bright,
Wherever I may go.

God make my life a little flower
That giveth joy to all,
Content to bloom in native bower,
Although the place be small.

God make my life a little song
That comforteth the sad,
That helpeth others to be strong,
And makes the singer glad.

God make my life a little staff,
Whereon the weak may rest;
That so what health and strength I have
May serve my neighbours best.

God make my life a little hymn
Of tenderness and praise;
Of faith—that never waxeth dim,
In all His wondrous ways.


1144
I love to think, though I am young

I love to think, though I am young,
My Saviour was a child;
That Jesus walked this earth along,
With feet all undefined.

He kept His Father's word of truth,
As I am taught to do;
And while He walked the paths of youth,
He walked in wisdom too.

I love to think that He who spake,
And made the blind to see,
And called the sleeping dead to wake,
Was once a child like me.

That He who wore the thorny crown,
And tasted death's despair,
Had a kind mother like my own,
And knew her love and care.

I know 'twas all for love of me
That He became a child,
And left the heavens so fair to see,
And trod earth's pathway wild.

Then, Saviour, who wast once a child,
A child may come to Thee;
And oh, in all Thy mercy mild,
Dear Saviour, come to me!


1145
The morning bright with rosy light

The morning bright with rosy light
Has waked me from my sleep;
Father, I own Thy love alone
Thy little one doth keep.

All through the day, I humbly pray,
Be thou my guard and guide;
My sins forgive, and let me live,
Lord Jesus, near Thy side.

Oh, make Thy rest within my breast,
Great Spirit of all grace;
Make me like Thee; then shall I be
Prepared to see Thy face.


1146
The wise may bring their learning

The wise may bring their learning,
The rich may bring their wealth;
And some may bring their greatness,
And some bring strength and health.
We too would bring our treasures
To offer to the King:
We have no wealth or learning;
What shall we children bring?

We'll bring Him hearts that love Him,
We'll bring Him thankful praise,
And young souls meekly striving
To walk in holy ways.
And these shall be the treasures
We offer to the King;
And these are gifts that even
The poorest child may bring.

We'll bring the little duties
We have to do each day;
We'll try our best to please Him
At home, at school, at play.
And better are these treasures
To offer to our King,
Than richest gifts without them;
Yet these a child may bring.


1147
In many a little village, in many a city great

In many a little village, in many a city great,
The rich men, and the noble, and men of poor estate,
Are entering this morning the Father's house of prayer—
And wheresoe'er they seek Him, we know that He is there.

And we, His little children, are gathered here to-day;
Our schoolroom is the temple in which we meet to pray:
It is the gate of heaven, it is the house of God—
For He Himself is present, according to His word.

Lord, make us really sorry as we our sins confess,
And may we feel Thee near us, to pardon and to bless:
O purify, dear Saviour, our naughty hearts to-day,
That gladly we may praise Thee, and humbly we may pray!

And when Thy servant speaketh the word that Thou hast given,
May we receive it gladly — a message sent from heaven:
And as we humbly listen, do Thou to each heart speak
A word to bring us gladness throughout the coming week.

Here may we learn to please Thee in work-time and at play —
To seek Thee and to serve Thee, to love Thy holy day:
Thus bless our children's service, and fill us with Thy grace,
And make each heart Thy temple, Thy earthly dwelling-place.


1148
Hushed was the evening hymn

Hushed was the evening hymn,
The temple courts were dark;
The lamp was burning dim
Before the sacred ark:
When suddenly a voice divine
Rang through the silence of the shrine.

Oh, give me Samuel's ear—
The open ear, O Lord!
Alive and quick to hear
Each whisper of Thy word;
Like him to answer at Thy call,
And to obey Thee first of all.

Oh, give me Samuel's heart! —
A lowly heart, that waits
When in Thy house Thou art;
Or watches at Thy gates
By day and night—a heart that still
Moves at the breathing of Thy will.

Oh, give me Samuel's mind!
A sweet, unmurmuring faith,
Obedient and resigned
To Thee in life and death:
That I may read, with childlike eyes,
Truths that are hidden from the wise.


1149
Gentle Jesus, meek and mild

Gentle Jesus, meek and mild,
Look upon a little child;
Pity my simplicity,
Suffer me to come to Thee.

Fain I would to Thee be brought;
Blessed Lord, forbid it not;
In the Kingdom of Thy grace
Give a little child a place.

Lamb of God, I look to Thee;
Thou shalt my example be;
Thou art gentle, meek, and mild;
Thou wast once a little child.

Fain I would be as Thou art;
Give me Thy obedient heart;
Thou art pitiful and kind,
Let me have Thy loving mind.

Loving Jesus, gentle Lamb,
In Thy gracious hands I am;
Make me, Saviour, what Thou art,
Live Thyself within my heart.


1150
Great God, and wilt Thou condescend

Great God, and wilt Thou condescend
To be my Father and my Friend?
I a poor child, and Thou so high,
The Lord of earth, and air, and sky?

Art Thou my Father? Canst Thou bear
To hear my poor imperfect prayer?
Or wilt Thou listen to the praise
That such a little one can raise?

Art Thou my Father? Let me be
A meek, obedient child to Thee;
And try in word, and deed, and thought,
To serve and please Thee as I ought.

Art Thou my Father? I'll depend
Upon the care of such a Friend;
And only wish to do and be
Whatever seemeth good to Thee.

Art Thou my Father? Then at last,
When all my days on earth are past,
Send down and take me in Thy love
To be Thy better child above.


1151
You're starting, my boy, on life's journey

You're starting, my boy, on life's journey,
Along the grand highway of life;
You'll meet with a thousand temptations —
Each city with evil is rife.
This world is a stage of excitement,
There's danger wherever you go;
But if you are tempted in weakness,
Have courage, my boy, to say No!

c
Have courage, my boy, to say No! . .
Have courage, my boy, to say No! . .
Have courage, my boy, have courage, my boy,
Have courage, my boy, to say No!

In courage, my boy, lies your safety,
When you the long journey begin;
Your trust in a heavenly Father
Will keep you unspotted from sin.
Temptations will go on increasing,
As streams from a rivulet flow;
But if you'd be true to your manhood,
Have courage, my boy, to say No!

Be careful in choosing companions:
Seek only the brave and the true;
And stand by your friends when in trial
Ne'er changing the old for the new.
And when by false friends you are tempted
The taste of the wine-cup to know,
With firmness, with patience, and kindness,
Have courage, my boy, to say No!


1152
It is a thing most wonderful

It is a thing most wonderful,
Almost too wonderful to be;
That God's own Son should come from heaven,
And die to save a child like me.

And yet I know that it is true:
He chose a poor and humble lot,
And wept, and toiled, and mourned, and died,
For love of those who loved Him not.

I cannot tell how He could love
A child so weak and full of sin;
His love must be most wonderful,
If He could die my love to win.

It is most wonderful to know
His love for me so free and sure;
But 'tis more wonderful to see
My love for Him so faint and poor.

And yet I want to love Thee, Lord;
Oh, light the flame within my heart,
And I will love Thee more and more,
Until I see Thee as Thou art.


1153
Jesus is our Shepherd, wiping every tear

Jesus is our Shepherd, wiping every tear;
Folded in His bosom, what have we to fear!
Only let us follow whither He doth lead,
To the thirsty desert, or the dewy mead.

Jesus is our Shepherd: well we know His voice,
How its gentlest whisper makes our heart rejoice;
Even when He chideth, tender is His tone:
None but He shall guide us; we are His alone,

Jesus is our Shepherd, for the sheep He bled;
Every lamb is sprinkled with the blood He shed;
Then on each He setteth His own secret sign:
They that have My Spirit, these, saith He, are Mine.

Jesus is our Shepherd; guarded by His arm,
Though the wolves may ravin, none can do us harm:
When we tread death's valley, dark with fearful gloom,
We will fear no evil, victors o'er the tomb.


1154
Jesus, tender Saviour

Jesus, tender Saviour,
Thou hast died for me!
Make me very thankful
In my heart to Thee.
When the sad, sad story
Of Thy grief I read,
Make me very sorry
For my sins indeed.

Now I know Thou lovest,
And dost plead for me!
Make me very thankful
In my prayers to Thee.
Soon I hope in glory
At Thy side to stand;
Make me fit to meet Thee
In that happy land.


1155
Jesus loves me! this I know

Jesus loves me! this I know,
For the Bible tells me so;
Little ones to Him belong;
They are weak, but He is strong.

c
Yes, Jesus loves me! Yes, Jesus loves me!
Yes, Jesus loves me I The Bible tells me so!

Jesus loves me! He who died
Heaven's gate to open wide:
He will wash away my sin,
Let His little child come in.

Jesus loves me! He will stay
Close beside me all the way:
If I love Him, when I die
He will take me home on high.


1156
I love to hear the story

I love to hear the story
Which angel voices tell,
How once the King of Glory
Came down on earth to dwell:
I am both weak and sinful,
But this I surely know:
The Lord came down to save me,
Because He loved me so!

I'm glad my blessed Saviour
Was once a child like me,
To show how pure and holy
His little ones might be;
And if I try to follow
His footsteps here below,
He never will forget me,
Because He loves me so!

To sing His love and mercy,
My sweetest songs I'll raise;
And though I cannot see Him,
I know He hears my praise;
For He has kindly promised
That I shall surely go
To sing among His angels,
Because He loves me so!


1157
Hark! hark! the song from youthful voices breaking

Hark! hark! the song from youthful voices breaking,
Fresh from the heart its tuneful numbers flow;
How sweet the song of happy children marching,
Praising the Saviour as they onward go!

c
Hark! hark! the song of holy adoration.
Glory to Jesus, our Eternal King;
Praise ye His name, exalt Him in the highest;
Now, and for ever, shall the anthem ring.

Hark! hark! the song, the grand old story telling;
Oh, how it swells and echoes far away!
Life, love, and joy, through Him who hath redeemed us,
Freely are offered in His name to-day.

Sing, children, sing! the song you now are waking,
Long, long ago on Judah's plain began;
When from the sky was heard the midnight chorus,
Peace from our Father, and goodwill to men.

Sing, children, sing, till—forward still advancing —
Rank after rank the royal standard wave!
Sing, gladly sing, the wonders of His greatness!
Jesus, the mighty One, the Strong to save!


1158
Trying to walk in the steps of the Saviour

Trying to walk in the steps of the Saviour,
Trying to follow our Saviour and King;
Shaping our lives by His blessed example,
Happy, how happy the songs that we bring!

c
How beautiful to follow the steps of the Saviour,
Walking in the light, walking in the light!
How beautiful to follow the steps of the Saviour,
Led in paths of right!

Clinging more closely to Him who is leading,
When we are tempted to turn from the way;
Trusting the Arm that is strong to defend us,
Happy, how happy our praise every day!

Walking by faith in the steps of the Saviour,
Upward, still upward, we'll follow our Guide;
When we shall see Him, "the King in His beauty,"
Happy, how happy our place at His side!


1159
Saviour, where Thou leadest

Saviour, where Thou leadest,
We will follow Thee;
Where Thy lambs Thou feedest,
We will follow Thee;
By Thy loving smile attended,
By Thy gentle hand defended,
Till this mortal life is ended,
We will follow Thee.

In life's early morning
We will follow Thee;
We have heard Thy warning —
We will follow Thee;
If our feet seem sometimes weary,
And the way seems long and dreary,
Thou wilt speak, and we shall hear Thee,
And will follow Thee.

In our days of gladness
We will follow Thee;
In our times of sadness
We will follow Thee;
Thou wilt give us, without measure,
Richest blessings, truest pleasure,
And in heaven, a priceless treasure,
We will follow Thee.


1160
Saviour, help us in our weakness

Saviour, help us in our weakness,
Guide and keep us hour by hour;
Help us meet the world's temptations
With Thine overcoming power.
Nothing can we do without Thee,
But all grace we know is Thine;
Strengthen us for every duty,
Fill us with Thy love divine.

Help us take Thy yoke upon us,
And Thy blessed word obey,
Learn of Thee, the" Meek and Lowly,"
Humbly serving, day by day.
May we grow like Thee, our Saviour,
Whom, though still unseen, we love;
Help us show the light to others,
Show the light that leads above.


1161
Saviour, who Thy flock art feeding

Saviour, who Thy flock art feeding
With the Shepherd's kindest care,
All the feeble gently leading,
While the lambs Thy bosom share:

Now, these little ones receiving,
Fold them in Thy gracious arm;
There, we know, Thy word believing,
They are all secure from harm.

Never, from Thy pasture roving,
Let them be the lion's prey;
Let Thy tenderness, so loving,
Keep them through life's dangerous way.

Then within Thy fold eternal
Let them find a resting-place;
Feed in pastures ever vernal,
Drink the rivers of Thy grace.


1162
By cool Siloam's shady rill

By cool Siloam's shady rill
How sweet the lily grows!
How sweet the breath, beneath the hill,
Of Sharon's dewy rose!

Lo! such the child whose early feet
The paths of peace have trod—
Whose secret heart, with influence sweet,
Is upward drawn to God.

By cool Siloam's shady rill
The lily must decay;
The rose that blooms beneath the hill
Must shortly fade away.

And soon, too soon, the wintry hour
Of man's maturer age
Will shake the soul with sorrow's power,
And stormy passion's rage.


1163
Early seeking, early finding

Early seeking, early finding,
Ever happy, happy we;
Looking up in life's sweet morning.
Coming, coming now to Thee,
We begin our children's days,
Lord of Glory, with Thy praise.

Early asking, early getting,
Ever happy, happy we;
We would ever, blessed Jesus,
Love and follow, follow Thee:
In Thy presence there is joy,
In Thy service blest employ.

Early knocking, early opening,
Ever happy, happy we;
By the holy gate we enter,
Lord, to dwell, to dwell with Thee;
In the city of the blest,
In the home of heavenly rest.

Early loving, early trusting,
Ever happy, happy we;
Mounting upward, pressing onward,
Closer, closer drawn to Thee;
Earthly joys we leave behind,
All in Thee, O Christ, to find.


1164
Saviour, like a shepherd lead us

Saviour, like a shepherd lead us,
Much we need Thy tenderest care;
In Thy pleasant pastures feed us,
For our use Thy folds prepare.
Blessed Jesus, blessed Jesus,
Thou hast bought us, Thine we are.

We are Thine: do Thou befriend us,
Be the Guardian of our way;
Keep Thy flock, from sin defend us,
Seek us when we go astray.
Blessed Jesus, blessed Jesus,
Hear, oh hear us when we pray.

Thou hast promised to receive us,
Poor and sinful though we be;
Thou hast mercy to relieve us,
Grace to cleanse, and power to free.
Blessed Jesus, blessed Jesus,
Let us early turn to Thee.

Early let us seek Thy favour,
Early let us do Thy will;
Blessed Lord and only Saviour,
With Thy love our bosoms fill.
Blessed Jesus, blessed Jesus,
Thou hast loved us, love us still.


1165
Come to the Saviour, make no delay

Come to the Saviour, make no delay;
Here in His word He has shown us the way;
Here in our midst He's standing to-day,
Tenderly saying, "Come!"

c
Joyful, joyful, will the meeting be,
When from sin our hearts are pure and free;
And we shall gather, Saviour, with Thee,
In our eternal home.

"Suffer the children!" Oh, hear His voice!
Let every heart leap forth and rejoice
And let us freely make Him our choice
Do not delay, but come.

Think once again, He's with us to-day
Heed now His blest command, and obey
Hear now His accents tenderly say,
"Will you, my children, come?"


1166
We want the young for Jesus

We want the young for Jesus;
Now in their youthful days,
Oh, may they seek the Saviour,
And early sing His praise.

c
O Lord, in life's bright morning,
To Thee our hearts we bring;
Our praises Thou wilt welcome,
When from the heart we sing.

We want the young for Jesus;
On earth, when He was near,
With gentle, sweet affection
He drew the children near.

And still He waits to bless them
With fond and yearning love:
Kind Shepherd, He would lead them
Safe to the fold above.

We want the young for Jesus:
Be this our blest employ;
No mission could be nobler,
Or fraught with sweeter joy

For e'en the tiniest jewel
Shall shine in Jesus' crown,
And sparkle there for ever
When time itself has flown.


1167
Be the matter what it may, always speak the truth

Be the matter what it may, always speak the truth;
Whether at your work or play, always speak the truth;
Never from this rule depart, grave it deeply on your heart,
Written 'tis upon your chart:
"Always speak the truth!"

There's a charm in honesty, always speak the truth;
There is meanness in a lie; always speak the truth;
He is but a coward slave, who, a present pain to waive,
Stoops to falsehood; then, be brave;
Always speak the truth.

When you're wrong, the folly own, always speak the truth;
There's a triumph to be won, always speak the truth;
He who speaks with lying tongue adds to wrong a greater wrong;
Then, with courage true and strong,
Always speak the truth.


1168
Careless soul, thy Saviour sees thee

Careless soul, thy Saviour sees thee;
Don't hold back!
Yearns till from thy thrall He frees thee
Don't hold back!
Sin, long cherished, claims and shames thee,
When aroused, thy conscience blames thee,
Thou art lost till Christ reclaims thee
Don't hold back!

Anxious soul, thy Saviour knows thee;
Should temptation still oppose thee;
Death, delayed, will soon o'ertake thee,
Then, when earthly friends forsake thee,
None but Christ to heaven can take thee;
Don't hold back!

Stricken soul, thy Saviour calls thee;
Though thy guilty fear appals thee;
Now the Lord of life has found thee,
He will break the chains that bound thee,
With the arms of love surround thee;
Don't hold back!

Pardoned soul, thy Saviour woos thee;
In His service He would use thee;
Though the hosts of hell assail thee,
His protection ne'er shall fail thee,
Till as victor heaven shall hail thee;
Don't hold back!

Ransomed soul, thy Saviour heeds thee;
When to pastures green He leads thee;
Onward, upward, He will guide thee,
Every needful good provide thee,
Keeping ever close beside thee;
Don't hold back!

Gracious soul, thy Saviour owns thee;
Till, triumphant, He enthrones thee;
Death's dark stream may lie before thee,
Angel guards are watching o'er thee;
Loved ones, glorified, call for thee;
Don't hold back!

Happy soul, thy Saviour loves thee,
And when He in mercy proves thee;
He to save and sanctify thee
Grace for grace will not deny thee;
When He comes to glorify thee,
Don't hold back!


1169
O golden day, when light shall break

O golden day, when light shall break,
And dawn's bright glories shall unfold,
When He who knows the path I take,
Shall ope for me the gates of gold.
Earth's little while will soon be past,
My pilgrim song will soon be o'er,
The grace that saves shall time outlast,
And be my theme on yonder shore.

c
Then I shall know as I am known,
And stand complete before the throne
Then I shall see my Saviour's face,
And all my song be saving grace.

Life's upward way, a narrow path,
Leads on to that fair dwelling-place,
Where, safe from sin and storm and wrath,
They live who trust redeeming grace.
Sing, sing, my heart, along the way,
Thegrace that saves will keep and guide,
Till breaks the glorious crowning day,
And I shall cross to yonder side.

I dimly see my journey's end,
But well I know who guideth me:
I follow Him, that wondrous Friend
Whose matchless love is full and free.
And when with Him I enter in,
And all the way look back to trace,
The conqueror's palm I then shall win,
Through Christ and His redeeming grace.


1170
O my Redeemer, What a Friend Thou art to me!

O my Redeemer,
What a Friend Thou art to me!
Oh, what a Refuge
I have found in Thee!
When the way was dreary,
And my heart was sore oppressed,
'Twas Thy voice that lulled me
To a calm, sweet rest.

c
Nearer, draw nearer,
Till my soul is lost in Thee;
Nearer, draw nearer,
Blessed Lord, to me.

When in their beauty
Stars unveil their silver light,
Then, O my Saviour,
Give me songs at night—
Songs of yonder mansions,
Where the dear ones, gone before,
Sing Thy praise for ever,
On that peaceful shore.

Jesus, my Saviour,
When the last deep shadows fall;
When in the silence
I shall hear Thy call -
In Thine arms reposing,
Let me breathe my life away,
And awake triumphant,
In eternal day.


1171
From every stormy wind that blows

From every stormy wind that blows,
From every swelling tide of woes,
There is a calm, a sure retreat;
'Tis found beneath the mercy-seat.

There is a place where Jesus sheds
The oil of gladness on our heads —
A place than all besides more sweet;
It is the blood-stained mercy-seat.

There is a scene where spirits blend,
Where friend holds fellowship with friend;
Though sundered far, by faith they meet:
Around one common mercy-seat.

There, there, on eagle wings we soar,
And sense and sin molest no more;
And heaven comes down our souls to greet,
And glory crowns the mercy-seat!

Oh, let my hand forget her skill,
My tongue be silent, cold, and still,
This bounding heart forget to beat,
If I forget the mercy-seat!


1172
Jesus, Lover of my soul.

(See No. 227.)

Though your sins be as scarlet

"Though your sins be as scarlet,
They shall be as white as snow;
Though your sins be as scarlet,
They shall be as white as snow;
Though they be red . . . like crimson
They shall be as wool;"
"Though your sins be as scarlet,
Though your sins be as scarlet,
They shall be as white as snow,
They shall be as white as snow."

Hear the voice that entreats you:
Oh, return ye unto God!
He is of great . . . compassion,
And of wondrous love;
Hear the voice that entreats you,
Hear the voice that entreats you:
Oh, return ye unto God!

He'll forgive your transgressions,
And remember them no more;
"Look unto Me, ... ye people,"
Saith the Lord your God;
He'll forgive your transgressions,
He'llf orgive your transgressions,
And remember them no more.

Rise, ye children of salvation

Rise, ye children of salvation,
All who cleave to Christ the Head;
Wake, arise! O mighty nation,
Ere the foe on Zion tread.

c
. . . Pour it forth . . a mighty anthem, . .
Like the thun - - ders of the sea; . .
Through the blood of Christ our ransom, . .
More than conquerors are we! . . .
More than con querors are we, . . .
More than con querors are we; . . .
Through the blood of Christ our ransom,
More than conquerors are we.

Saints and heroes Jong before us
Firmly on this ground have stood;
See their banners waving o'er us,
Conquerors through Jesus' blood.

Deathless, we are all unfearing,
Life laid up with Christ in God;
In the morn of His appearing
Floweth forth a glory flood.

Soon we all shall stand before Him,
See and know our glorious Lord;
Soon in joy and light adore Him,
Each receiving his reward.


1175
Our Fatherland, thy name so dear

Our Fatherland, thy name so dear,
Our souls repeat while strangers here;
And oh, how oft we sigh for thee,
Dear Fatherland beyond the sea!

c
Our Fatherland, . . . dear Fatherland, . . .
We long to press . . . thy golden strand, . . .
And hail the bright . . . and shining band, . . .
In thy sweet vales, . . . dear Fatherland! . .

Above the stars, above the skies,
Thy towering hills in beauty rise;
Where sunny fields with verdure glow,
And fadeless flowers in beauty grow.

There Jesus reigns, our Saviour King,
And one by one His own will bring,
Thy songs to join, thy bliss to share,
O Fatherland, O Zion fair!

No tears shall dim, no pain destroy
The light of peace, the smile of joy;
No more we'll clasp the parting hand
Within the gates, our Fatherland.


1176
Along the River of Time we glide

Along the River of Time we glide,
Along the River, along the River;
The swiftly flowing, resistless tide,
The swiftly flowing, the swiftly flowing,
And soon, ah, soon, the end we'll see;
Yes, soon 'twill come, and we will be
Floating, floating,
Out on the sea of Eternity!

Along the River of Time we glide,
Along the River, along the River;
A thousand dangers its currents hide,
A thousand dangers, a thousand dangers;
And near our course the rocks we see:
Oh, dreadful thought! a wreck to be,
Floating, floating,
Out on the sea of Eternity!

Along the River of Time we glide,
Along the River, along the River;
Our Saviour only our bark can guide,
Our Saviour only, our Saviour only;
But with Him we secure may be:
No fear, no doubt—but joy to be
Floating, floating,
Out on the sea of Eternity!


1177
They are gathering homeward from every land

They are gathering homeward from every land,
One by one, one by one;
As their weary feet touch the shining strand,
Yes, one by one.
Their brows are enclosed in a golden crown,
Their travel-stained garments are all laid down;
And clothed in white raiment they rest in the mead,
Where the Lamb doth love His saints to lead.

c
Gathering home, gathering home,
Fording the river, one by one;
Gathering home, gathering home,
Yes, one by one.

We, too, shall come to the river side,
One by one, one by one:
We are nearer its waters each eventide,
Yes, one by one.
To some are the floods of the river stil ,
As they ford on their way to the heavenly hill!
To others the waves run fiercely and wild,
Yet they reach the home of the undefiled.

Jesus, Redeemer, we look to Thee,
One by one, one by one;
We lift lip our voices tremblingly,
Yes, one by one.
The waves of the river are dark and cold,
But we know the place where our feet shall hold;
O Thou, who didst pass through in deepest midnight,
Now guide us, and send us the staff and light.

Say, where is thy refuge, my brother

Say, where is thy refuge, my brother,
And what is thy prospect to-day?
Why toil for the wealth that will perish,
The treasures that rust and decay?
Oh, think of thy soul, that for ever
Must live on eternity's shore;
When thou in the dust art forgotten,
When pleasure can charm thee no more.

c
'Twill profit thee nothing, but fearful the cost
To gain the whole world if thy soul should be lost.

The Master is calling thee, brother,
In tones of compassion and love,
To feel that sweet rapture of pardon,
And lay up thy treasure above:
Oh, kneel at the cross where He suffered
To ransom thy soul from the grave;
The arm of His mercy will hold thee,
The arm that is mighty to save.

As summer is waning, my brother,
Repent, ere the season is past;
God's goodness to thee is extended
As long as the daybeam shall last;
Then slight not the warning repeated
With all the bright moments that roll;
Nor say, when the harvest is ended,
That no one hath cared for thy soul.


1179
All for Jesus! all for Jesus

All for Jesus! all for Jesus!
All my being's ransomed powers;
All my thoughts and words and doings,
All my days and all my hours.

c
All for Jesus! all for Jesus!
All my being's ransomed powers;
All for Jesus! all for Jesus!
All my days and all my hours.

Let my hands perform His bidding;
Let my feet run in His ways;
Let my eyes see Jesus only;
Let my lips speak forth His praise.

c
All for Jesus! all for Jesus!
Let my feet run in His ways;
All for Jesus! all for Jesus!
Let my lips speak forth His praise.

Since my eyes were fixed on Jesus,
I've lost sight of all beside—
So enchained my spirit's vision,
Looking at the Crucified.

c
All for Jesus! all for Jesus!
I've lost sight of all beside;
All for Jesus! all for Jesus!
All for Jesus Crucified!

Come close to the Saviour, thy loving Redeemer

Come close to the Saviour, thy loving Redeemer,
O sorrowing heart oppressed; . . .
Life's journey is dreary, thy spirit is weary,
Oh, come unto Him and rest,
Come close to the Saviour, oh, why dost thou linger?
He knoweth thy heart oppressed; . . .
His promise believing, His message receiving,
Oh, come unto Him and rest!

c
Peacefully, tranquilly, tenderly rest,
Looking to Jesus above; . . .
Peacefully, tranquilly, tenderly rest
Safe in the arms of His love. . . .

Come close to the Saviour, He calleth thee gently;
Draw near to thy Father's throne: . . .
His eyes will behold thee, His mercy enfold thee,
Why carry thy grief alone!
Come close to the Saviour, oh, trust and remember,
Through trials our souls are blest; . . .
Whatever betide thee, thy Refuge will hide thee,
Oh, come unto Him and rest!

Come close to thy Saviour, earth's pleasures are fleeting,
But Jesus will care for thee; . . .
Whatever may grieve thee, He never will leave thee,
Thy strength as thy day shall be.
Come close to the Saviour, while now He is calling,
Come home to the pure and blest; . . .
Where peace, like a river, flows onward for ever,
Oh, come unto Him and rest!

The cross it standeth fast

The cross it standeth fast,
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
Defying every blast,
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
The winds of hell have blown,
The world its hate hath shown,
Yet it is not overthrown,
Hallelujah for the cross!

c
Hallelujah! . . hallelujah! . . . hallelu - - jah
for the cross! . . .
Hallelujah! . . . hallelujah! . . .
It shall never . . suffer . . loss!
Hallelujah! hallelujah! hallelujah for the cross!
Hallelujah! hallelujah!
It shall never suffer loss.

It is the old cross still,
Its triumph let us tell,
The grace of God here shone,
Through Christ the blessed Son,
Who did for sin atone,
Hallelujah for the cross!

Twas here the debt was paid,
Our sins on Jesus laid,
So round the cross we sing,
Of Christ our Offering,
Of Christ our living King,
Hallelujah for the cross!


1182
I have heard of a Saviour's love

I have heard of a Saviour's love,
And a wonderful love it must be;
But did He come down from above,
Out of love and compassion for me?

c
"This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation,
that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners."

I have heard how He suffered and bled,
How He languished and died on the tree;
But then is it anywhere said
That He languished and suffered for me?

c
"He was wounded for our transgressions.
He was bruised for our iniquities;
the chastisement of our peace was upon Him;
and with His stripes we are healed."

I've been told of a heaven on high,
Which the children of Jesus shall see;
But is there a place in the sky
Made ready and furnished for me?

c
"In My Father's house are many mansions:
if it were not so, I would have told you.
I go to prepare a place for you;
that where I am, there ye may be also."

Lord, answer these questions of mine;
To whom shall I go but to Thee?
And say, by Thy Spirit divine,
There's a Saviour and heaven for me.

c
Yes, yes, yes, for me! for me!
Yes, yes, yes, for me! Our Lord from above,
in His infinite love,
On the cross died to save you and me.


1183
A sinner was wandering at eventide

A sinner was wandering at eventide,
His tempter was watching close by at his side;
In his heart raged a battle for right against wrong—
But hark! from the church he hears the sweet song:

c
Jesus, Lover of my soul,
Let me to Thy bosom fly.

He stopped and listened to every sweet chord,
He remembered the time he once loved the Lord:
Come on! says the tempter, come on with the throng—
But hark! from the church again swells the song:

c
While the billows near me roll,
While the tempest still is high.

Oh, tempter, depart, I have served thee too long;
I fly to the Saviour, He dwells in that song:
Lord, can it be that a sinner like me
May find a sweet refuge by coming to Thee?

c
Other refuge have I none;
Hangs my helpless soul on Thee.

I come, Lord, I come; Thou'lt forgive
the dark past, and

c
Oh, receive my soul at last


1184
Tis finished!" so the Saviour cried

"Tis finished!" so the Saviour cried,
And meekly bowed His head and died;
"'Tis finished!"— yes, the race is run,
The battle fought, the victory won.

"'Tis finished!" Heaven is reconciled,
And all the powers of darkness spoiled;
Peace, love, and happiness again
Return, and dwell with sinful men.

"'Tis finished!" let the joyful sound
Be heard through all the nations round;
"'Tis finished 1" let the echo fly
Through heaven and hell, through earth and sky.


1185
Some day, "we say, and turn our eyes

"Some day, "we say, and turn our eyes
Toward the fair hills of Paradise;
Some day, some time, a sweet new rest
Shall blossom, flower-like, in each breast;
Some day, some time, our eyes shall see
The faces kept in memory;
Some day, some time, our eyes shall see
The faces kept in memory.
Some day their hands shall clasp our hand,
Just over in the morning land,
Just over in the morning land;
Some day their hands shall clasp our hand,
Just over in the morning land:
Oh, morning land! Oh, morning land!

Some day our ears shall hear the song
Of triumph over sin and wrong;
Some day, some time—but oh, not yet;
But we will wait, and not forget
That some day all these things shall be,
And rest be given to you and me;
That some day all these things shall be,
And rest be given to you and me.
So wait, my friends, though years move slow,
That happy time will come, we know,
That happy time will come, we know;
So wait, my friends, though years move slow,
That happy time will come, we know:
Oh, morning land! Oh, morning land!


1186
In the secret of His presence how my soul delights to hide

In the secret of His presence how my soul delights to hide!
Oh, how precious are the lessons which I learn at Jesus' side!
Earthly cares can never vex me, neither trials lay me low:
For when Satan comes to tempt me, to the secret place I go.

When my soul is faint and thirsty, 'neath the shadow of His wing
There is cool and pleasant shelter, and a fresh and crystal spring;
And my Saviour rests beside me, as we hold communion sweet:
If I tried, I could not utter what He says when thus we meet.

Only this I know: I tell Him all my doubts, and griefs, and fears;
Oh, how patiently He listens! and my drooping soul He cheers:
Do you think He ne'er reproves me? what a false friend He would be,
If He never, never told me of the sins which He must see.

Would you like to know the sweetness of the secret of the Lord?
Go and hide beneath His shadow—this shall then be your reward:
And whene'er you leave the silence of that happy meeting-place,
You will bear the shining image of the Master in your face.

Beloved, "It is well,"

Beloved, "It is well,"
"It is well,"" It is well." . .
God's ways are always right;
And love is o'er them all,
Though far above our sight.
..." It is well,"" It is well."

Beloved, "It is well,"
"It is well,"" It is well." . .
Though deep and sore the smart,
He wounds who knows to bind
And heal the broken heart.
..." It is well,"" It is well."

Beloved, "It is well, "
"It is well,"" It is well." . .
Though sorrow clouds our way,
'Twill make the joy more dear
That ushers in the day.
..."It is well,"" It is well."

Beloved, "It is well, "
"It is well,"" It is well." . .
The path that Jesus trod,
Though rough and dark it be,
Leads home to heaven and God.
..." It is well,"" It is well.

If I were a voice, a persuasive voice

If I were a voice, a persuasive voice,
That could travel the wide world through,
I would fly on the beams of the morning light,
And speak to men with a gentle might,
And tell them to be true.
I would fly, I would fly over land and sea,
Wherever a human heart might be,
Telling a tale, or singing a song,
In praise of the right and in blame of the wrong:
I would fly, I would fly,
I would fly over land and sea.

If I were a voice, a consoling voice,
I would fly on the wings of the air;
The homes of sorrow and guilt I'd seek,
And calm and truthful words I'd speak,
To save them from despair.
I would fly, I would fly o'er the crowded town,
And drop like the happy sunlight down
Into the hearts of suffering men,
And teach them to look up again:
I would fly, I would fly,
I would fly o'er the crowded town.

If I were a voice, a convincing voice,
I would travel with the wind,
And wherever I saw the nations torn
By warfare, jealousy, spite or scorn,
Or hatred of their kind,
I would fly, I would fly on the thundercrash,
And into their blinded bosoms flash:
Then with their evil thoughts subdued,
I'd teach them Christian brotherhood:
I would fly, I would fly,
I would fly on the thunder-crash.

If I were a voice, an immortal voice,
I would fly the earth around;
And wherever man to his idols bowed,
I'd publish in notes both long and loud
The Gospel's joyful sound.
I would fly, I would fly on the wings of day,
Proclaiming peace on my world-wide way,
Bidding the saddened earth rejoice —
If I were a voice, an immortal voice,
I would fly, I would fly,
I would fly on the wings of day.

God is love! His mercy brightens

God is love! His mercy brightens
All the path in which we rove;
Bliss He wakes, and woe He lightens;
God is light, and God is love!

c
God is light, and God is love!
God is light, and God is love!

Chance and change are busy ever;
Man decays, and ages move;
But His mercy waneth never;
God is light, and God is love!

E'en the hour that darkest seemeth
Will His changeless goodness prove;
From the gloom His brightness streameth
God is light, and God is love!

Oh, the best Friend to have is Jesus

Oh, the best Friend to have is Jesus,
When the cares of life upon you roll;
He will heal the wounded heart,
He will strength and grace impart:
Oh, the best Friend to have is Jesus!

c
The best Friend to have is Je - - - sus!
The best Friend to have is Je - - - sus!
He will help you when you fall,
He will hear you when you call:
Oh, the best Friend to have is Jesus!

What a Friend I have found in Jesus!
Peace and comfort to my soul He brings;
Leaning on His mighty arm,
I will fear no ill nor harm:
Oh, the best Friend to have is Jesus!

Though I pass through the night of sorrow,
And the chilly waves of Jordan roll,
Never need I shrink nor fear,
For my Saviour is so near:
Oh, the best Friend to have is Jesus!
When at last to our home we gather,
With the loved ones who have gone before,
We will sing upon the shore,
Praising Him for evermore:
Oh, the best Friend to have is Jesus!

Beyond the smiling and the weeping

Beyond the smiling and the weeping,
I shall be soon;
Beyond the waking and the sleeping,
Beyond the sowing and the reaping,
I shall be soon.

c
Love, rest, and home! . .
Lord, tarry not, but come.

Beyond the blooming and the fading,
Beyond the shining and the shading,
Beyond the hoping and the dreading,
I shall be soon.

Beyond the rising and the setting,
Beyond the calming and the fretting,
Beyond remembering and forgetting,
I shall be soon.

Beyond the frost-chain and the fever,
Beyond the rock-waste and the river,
Beyond the" ever" and the" never,"
I shall be soon.

Beyond the parting and the meeting,
Beyond the farewell and the greeting,
Beyond the pulse's fever-beating,
I shall be soon.

The Saviour stands at thy door to-night

The Saviour stands at thy door to-night,
And is seeking thy heart to win;
The world for awhile has withdrawn its light:
Wilt thou open and let Him in?
He has travelled afar on a lonely road,
In sorrow and agony;
He has borne sin's heavy crushing load,
All, all for the sake of thee!

c
Let . . . Him in, . . . let . . . Him in; . . .
O - - pen the door . . and let . . Him come in.

He stands to plead with thee to-night,
While the dews of the evening fall;
O'er the moaning and surging waves of life,
Dost thou hear His yearning call
He will free thy soul from the chains of earth,
From its sorrow, its care, and sin;
He will give thee joy for its hollow mirth:
Wilt thou open and let Him in?

From the glorious heights of heaven He came,
To seek thee and to save;
But the world it gave Him a cross of shame,
And a lonely borrowed grave;
He left His radiant home above
To bear thy load of sin;
He died to prove His deep, deep love:
Wilt thou open and let Him in?

Thou hast wandered far in the paths of sin,
Thou art weary, and sad, and lone;
But His blood can cleanse, and His love can win:
Wilt thou make Him now thine own?
The world has given thee care and pain,
And mocked thee with its sin;
He will give the treasures of priceless gain:
Wilt thou open and let Him in?


1194
I have heard of a home far away above the skies

I have heard of a home far away above the skies,
Where the good and true may happy be;
I have looked through the stars,
and I've watched through lonely hours,
And I've wondered if there's room there for me?
Yes, there's room for you and for me,
And there's room for the whole world beside;
The wonderful love of the Lord reaches all;
It gently calls us now to His side.

c
Room for you and me,
And there's room for all;
Listen I listen! Hear His earnest call:
"Whosoever will may come, . . .
Come, ye that are weary,
And are heavy laden":
Listen, He's calling thee, there's room for all.

But they say that the righteous
shall scarcely enter there;
How, then, shall a sinner like me?
I am far, far away from the gentle Shepherd's care;
Oh, I wonder if He'll make room for me?
Yes, there's room, the call is for thee,
'Tis a grand invitation, full and free;
There's room for us all, if we list to His call;
Yes, He's willing to make room there for thee.


1195
I have read of a beautiful City

I have read of a beautiful City,
Far away in the kingdom of God;
I have read how its walls are of jasper,
How its streets are all golden and broad.
In the midst of the street is life's river,
Clear as crystal, and pure to behold;
But not half of that City's bright glory
To mortals has ever been told.

c
Not half has ever been told, . .
Not half has ever been told; . .
Not half of that City's bright glory
To mortals has ever been told.

I have read of bright mansions in Heaven,
Which the Saviour has gone to prepare;
And the saints who on earth have been faithful,
Rest for ever with Christ over there:
There no sin ever enters, nor sorrow,
The inhabitants never grow old;
But not half of the joys that await them
To mortals has ever been told.

I have read of white robes for the righteous,
Of bright crowns which the glorified wear,
When our Father shall bid them" Come,enter,
And My glory eternally share:"
How the righteous are evermore blessed,
As they walk through the streets of pure gold;
But not half of the wonderful story
To mortals has ever been told.

I have read of a Christ so forgiving,
That vile sinners may ask and receive
Peace, and pardon for every transgression,
If when asking they only believe.
I have read how He'll guide and protect us,,
If for safety we enter His fold;
But not half of His goodness and mercy
To mortals has ever been told.


1196
Weary child, thy sin forsaking, close thy heart no more

Weary child, thy sin forsaking, close thy heart no more;
From thy dream of pleasure waking, open wide its door.

c
While the lamp of life is burning,
And the heart of God is yearning,
To His loving arms returning,
Give thy wanderings o'er.

To the Saviour's tender pleading, close thy heart no more;
Now the call of mercy heeding, open wide its door.

To the Gospel invitation close thy heart no more;
To receive a full salvation open wide its door.

To the joy that fadeth never, close thy heart no more;
To the peace abiding ever, open wide its door.


1197
As I wandered round the homestead

As I wandered round the homestead,
Many a dear familiar spot
Brought within my recollection
Scenes I'd seemingly forgot;
There, the orchard—meadow, yonder—
Here, the deep, old-fashioned well,
With its old moss-covered bucket,
Sent a thrill no tongue can tell.

Though the house was held by strangers,
All remained the same within;
Just as when a child I rambled
Up and down, and out and in;
To the garret dark ascending—
Once a source of childish dread—
Peering through the misty cobwebs,
Lo! I saw my cradle bed.

Quick I drew it from the rubbish
Covered o'er with dust so long:
When, behold, I heard in fancy
Strains of one familiar song,
Often sung by my dear mother
To me in that cradle bed:
"Hush, my dear, lie still and slumber!
Holy angels guard thy bed!"

While I listen to the music
Stealing on in gentle strain,
I am carried back to childhood —
I am now a child again:
'Tis the hour of my retiring,
At the dusky eventide;
Near my cradle bed I'm kneeling,
As of yore, by mother's side.

Hands are on my head so loving,
As they were in childhood's days;
I, with weary tones, am trying
To repeat the words she says;
'Tis a prayer in language simple
As a mother's lips can frame:
"Father, Thou who art in heaven,
Hallowed, ever, be Thy name."

Prayer is over: to my pillow
With a" good-night" kiss I creep,
Scarcely waking while I whisper,
"Now I lay me down to sleep."
Then my mother, o'er me bending,
Prays in earnest words, but mild:
"Hear my prayer, O heavenly Father,
Bless, oh bless, my precious child!"

Yet I am but only dreaming:
Ne'er I'll be a child again;
Many years has that dear mother
In the quiet graveyard lain;
But her blessed angel spirit
Daily hovers o'er my head,
Calling me from earth to heaven,
Even from my cradle bed.


1198
Lead me gently home, Father

Lead me gently home, Father,
Lead me gently home!
'Mid life's darkest hours, Father,
When sad trials come.
Keep my heart from wandering,
Lest my feet should roam;
Lest I fall upon the wayside,
Lead me gently home!

c
. . . Lead me gently home, . Father
Lead me gently,
Lest I fall upon the wayside,
Lead me gently home!

Lead me gently home, Father,
Lead me gently home!
None but Thou can'st guide me,
I cannot walk alone!
I will gladly follow,
Ever follow on:
By Thy loving hand, O Father,
Lead me gently home!

Lead me gently home, Father,
Lead me gently home!
When life's toils are ended,
And parting days have come,
There to rest for ever
From all earthly gloom,
Lead me, O my heavenly Father,
Lead me gently home!

God save our gracious King

God save our gracious King,
Long live our noble King,
God save the King!
Send him victorious,
Happy and glorious,
Long to reign over us:
God save the King!

Thy choicest gifts in store
On him be pleased to pour;
Long may he reign.
May he defend our laws,
And ever give us cause
To sing with heart and voice,
God save the King!

My country! 'tis of thee

My country! 'tis of thee,
Sweet land of liberty,
Of thee I sing:
Land where my fathers died!
Land of the Pilgrims' pride!
From every mountain-side
Let Freedom ring!

My native country, thee—
Land of the noble free—
Thy name I love:
I love thy rocks and rills,
Thy woods and templed hills;
My heart with rapture thrills
Like that above.

Let music swell the breeze,
And ring from all the trees
Sweet Freedom's song:
Let mortal tongues awake;
Let all that breathe partake;
Let rocks their silence break—
The sound prolong.

Our fathers' God! to Thee,
Author of liberty,
To Thee we sing:
Long may our land be bright
With Freedom's holy light;
Protect us by Thy might,
Great God, our King!
