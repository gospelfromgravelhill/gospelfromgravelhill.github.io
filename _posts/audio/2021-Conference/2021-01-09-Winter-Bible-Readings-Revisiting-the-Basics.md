Frequently, along life’s pathway, there is a need to pause and revisit the fundamentals of Christianity. While we know them, we must keep them in remembrance. This is what Peter was suggesting in 2 Peter 1:12, “Wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things, though ye know them, and be established in the present truth”. <br>

In light of this need, the Christians that meet at the Pope Road Gospel Hall in Summerside, PE, hosted six nights of Bible Readings on Basic Christian Truth. These Bible Readings were lead by John Meekin (Bridgewater, NS), Scott MacLeod (Darlington, PE), and Brody Thibodeau (Cambellton, PE). <br>
