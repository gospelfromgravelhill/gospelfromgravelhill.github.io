  <h2>The Gospel from Gravel Hill</h2>

  <p>From 2012 to 2025, The Glorious Gospel Website (<a href="https://www.thegloriousgospel.ca" target="_blank">www.thegloriousgospel.ca</a>) stood as a faithful online witness to the beauty and truth of the gospel message.</p>

  <p>Founded and maintained by Scott G. MacLeod, the site was built around the words of 1 Timothy 1:11: <strong>"the glorious gospel of the blessed God"</strong> and sought to proclaim the riches of Christ through Scripture, ministry, and reflection.</p>

  <p>As this chapter of the site’s history has come to a close, we wish to express our heartfelt thanks to Scott for over a decade of unwavering dedication. His work was more than just web content — it was a spiritual labour that pointed many to Christ and encouraged countless believers in their walk.</p>

  <p>We are grateful for the clarity, reverence, and gospel-centeredness that marked every page.</p>

  <p>With his permission, we now humbly hope to continue in some small way what he so faithfully began. This section of our site exists not to replace, but to preserve and carry forward the spirit and content of The Glorious Gospel website.</p>

  <p>Our prayer is that it will still serve the Lord’s people, point sinners to the Saviour, and honour the God who gave us so glorious a message.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  Romans 16:27<br>
  [27] To God only wise, be glory through Jesus Christ for ever. Amen.
